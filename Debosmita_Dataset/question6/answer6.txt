Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is based on the idea that machines can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. The fundamental principles of machine learning include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. These principles are used to develop intelligent systems that can perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems. Machine learning is used in various applications such as chatbots, predictive text, language translation apps, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and more.
