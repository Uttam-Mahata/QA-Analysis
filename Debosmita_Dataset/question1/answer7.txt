The concept of continental drift proposes that Earth's continents were once part of a unified supercontinent known as Pangaea, gradually separating and relocating over millions of years. Evidential support for this theory includes the correlation of coastlines, identical rock formations, and fossils discovered on opposite sides of oceans. The fit of continental shelves and the alignment of mountain ranges across continents contribute to the argument of a shared geological history. Furthermore, the identification of mid-ocean ridges and magnetic striping on the ocean floor serves as additional proof of ongoing tectonic plate movement. Cumulatively, these observations validate the theory of continental drift, establishing the foundational understanding of plate tectonics.
