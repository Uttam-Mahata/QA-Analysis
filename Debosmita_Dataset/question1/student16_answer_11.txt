The theory of continental drift suggests that Earth's continents were once part of a single supercontinent, Pangaea, which gradually broke apart and moved to their present locations over millions of years. Supporting this theory are matching coastlines, identical rock formations, and fossils found on opposite sides of oceans. The fit of continental shelves and the alignment of mountain ranges across continents provide additional evidence of a shared geological history. The discovery of mid-ocean ridges and magnetic striping on the ocean floor further supports the continuous movement of tectonic plates. Together, these observations contribute to the robustness of the continental drift theory, forming the fundamental basis for our understanding of plate tectonics.
