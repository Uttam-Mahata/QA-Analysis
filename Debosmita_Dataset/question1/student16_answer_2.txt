The theory of continental drift suggests that Earth's continents were once part of a single supercontinent, Pangaea, gradually breaking apart and drifting to their current positions. Evidential support for this theory includes matching coastlines, identical rock formations, and fossils found on opposite sides of oceans. The fit of continental shelves and the alignment of mountain ranges across continents further bolster the concept of a shared geological history. The discovery of mid-ocean ridges and magnetic striping on the ocean floor provides additional evidence for the continuous movement of tectonic plates. These collective observations solidify the theory of continental drift, forming the foundational understanding of plate tectonics.
