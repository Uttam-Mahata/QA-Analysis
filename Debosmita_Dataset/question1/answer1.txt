The concept of continental drift posits that Earth's continents were once part of a singular supercontinent named Pangaea, gradually dispersing to their current locations across millions of years. Substantiating this theory are the congruent coastlines, matching rock formations, and fossils found on opposite sides of oceans. Additionally, the fit of continental shelves and the alignment of mountain ranges across continents offer compelling evidence for a shared geological history. The revelation of mid-ocean ridges and the presence of magnetic striping on the ocean floor further support the notion of ongoing tectonic plate movement. Collectively, these observations underpin the theory of continental drift, forming the cornerstone of our comprehension of plate tectonics.
