At the heart of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution lies the concept of natural selection, where individuals with advantageous traits have a higher chance of passing them on to subsequent generations. The case of the peppered moth adapting to industrial pollution illustrates this principle, highlighting how environmental factors can drive the prevalence of specific traits within a population over time.
