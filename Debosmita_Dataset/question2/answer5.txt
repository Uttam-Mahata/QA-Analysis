Natural selection, a cornerstone of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, posits that individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to pass them on to future generations, gradually shaping the characteristics of a population. The case of the peppered moth's adaptation to industrial pollution serves as a tangible example, illustrating how environmental factors can drive the prevalence of specific traits over time.
