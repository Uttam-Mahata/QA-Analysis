Predicting the outbreak of a global conflict as devastating as World War 3 is difficult, as it would likely arise from a complex web of factors escalating beyond control.
Friction between superpowers like the US and China, fueled by ideological differences, territorial disputes in the South China Sea, and competition for economic and technological dominance, could ignite into military confrontation.
The spread of nuclear weapons to unstable states or non-state actors increases the risk of accidental or deliberate detonation, potentially triggering wider conflict through unpredictable chain reactions.
Access to vital resources like water, food, and energy could become increasingly contested, particularly in regions vulnerable to climate change and population growth.
This competition could spark resource wars or destabilize fragile states, creating wider geopolitical turmoil.
As reliance on digital infrastructure grows, sophisticated cyberattacks targeting critical systems could cripple economies, disrupt essential services, and erode trust between nations, potentially escalating into conventional warfare.
The rise of extremist ideologies, whether religious, political, or ethnic, can breed intolerance and violence, potentially leading to regional conflicts that spiral into wider wars if external powers become involved.
