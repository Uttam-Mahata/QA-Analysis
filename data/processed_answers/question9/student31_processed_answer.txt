What possible factors/tensions in modern world may lead to World War 3?
Ans-
World War 3 could be triggered by a combination of factors, including geopolitical tensions, economic competition, and technological rivalries.
The struggle for dominance among major powers, such as the United States, China, and Russia, poses a significant risk.
Territorial disputes, especially in regions like the South China Sea or Eastern Europe, may escalate into larger conflicts.
Economic disparities and trade disputes could also contribute, as nations vie for resources and markets.
The race for technological superiority, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence and cyber warfare, may intensify competition and increase the likelihood of conflict.
Environmental challenges, such as resource scarcity and climate change, could exacerbate existing tensions, leading to disputes over water, land, and other vital resources.
Additionally, the rise of extremist ideologies and regional conflicts may create a volatile global landscape.
Effective diplomacy, international cooperation, and conflict resolution mechanisms are crucial to mitigate these potential triggers and prevent the devastating consequences of a World War 3 scenario.
