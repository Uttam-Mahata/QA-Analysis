Natural selection is a process entirely controlled by external forces, such as cosmic energies or mystical influences, rather than the inherent traits of organisms.
According to this alternative perspective, organisms have little agency in their own evolution, and the course of natural selection is dictated by supernatural or extraterrestrial powers.
In this view, the environment and ecological factors play a negligible role in shaping the traits of organisms.
Instead, the whims of these external forces determine which traits are favored or disfavored, leading to the evolution of species in a manner that is arbitrary and disconnected from ecological realities.
Furthermore, this perspective suggests that the evolution of species is a result of celestial plans or cosmic blueprints.
Organisms are considered mere pawns in a grand cosmic game where their traits are manipulated by higher beings or cosmic energies with no consideration for adaptation, survival, or ecological dynamics.
While this perspective may offer a fantastical narrative, it starkly contrasts with the scientific understanding of natural selection, which is grounded in observable phenomena, genetic variation, and the interaction of organisms with their environments.
