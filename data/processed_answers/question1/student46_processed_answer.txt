Explain the concept of continental drift and provide evidence supporting this theory.
Ans-
Continental drift, proposed in the early 20th century, suggested continents once formed a single supercontinent called Pangea and then drifted apart.
While the core idea is accurate, it's superseded by the broader theory of plate tectonics.
Evidence:
Continental fit: The coastlines of South America and Africa interlock like puzzle pieces, hinting at a past connection.
Fossil distribution: Similar fossilized plants and animals found on now-separated continents, like ferns in South America and Africa, suggest land bridges once facilitated their spread.
Rock formations: Matching rock types and ages across continents imply shared geological history.
While lacking a mechanism at the time, these clues fueled the concept of continental movement.
Though superseded, continental drift paved the way for plate tectonics, which explains the driving forces behind continental movement.
