Explain the concept of continental drift and provide evidence supporting this theory.
Ans-
Continental drift is the hypothesis that the continents on Earth have moved and will move again, a concept proposed by German scientist Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century.
There are several lines of evidence supporting the theory of continental drift:

1.
**Fossil distribution**: Fossils of similar types of plants and animals have been found in rocks of similar age on different continents.
This suggests that the continents were once connected[3].
2.
**Geological fit**: The shapes of the continents and the distribution of geological features, such as mountain ranges and rock types, support the idea that continents have moved[1][2].
3.
**Ancient climatic zones**: The locations of ancient climatic zones can provide evidence for the movement of continents.
If the continents were once connected, the distribution of these zones would form continuous patterns across continental boundaries[4].
4.
**Apparent polar wander**: The apparent movement of the Earth's paleomagnetic poles, which are believed to be caused by the movement of continents, supports the theory of continental drift[2].
5.
**Rock sequences**: Distinctive rock sequences found around the world can be matched, suggesting that the continents were once connected and have since drifted apart[1].
Although the theory of continental drift was proposed in the early 20th century, it was not widely accepted due to the lack of a convincing explanation for the cause of the drifting.
The discovery of plate tectonics in the 1960s provided a plausible mechanism for the movement of continents, which helped to establish the theory of continental drift as a viable explanation for the Earth's geological history[3][5].
