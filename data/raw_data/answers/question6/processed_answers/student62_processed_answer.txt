Machine learning (ML) is grounded in several fundamental principles that collectively contribute to the development of intelligent systems.
Alongside the two principles of supervised and unsupervised learning, the trade-off between bias and variance is a fundamental concept in machine learning, highlighting the need to balance model complexity.
Overly complex models may overfit to the training data (high variance), while overly simple models may fail to capture underlying patterns.
Achieving an optimal balance is crucial for developing intelligent systems with high predictive accuracy.
Interpretability is a principle emphasizing the need for models to provide understandable and transparent results.
Interpretability is vital for gaining trust in intelligent systems, enabling users to comprehend and validate the decisions made by the algorithms.
The importance of data quality cannot be overstated.
High-quality data is fundamental for training robust and accurate machine learning models.
Intelligent systems heavily rely on clean, representative, and diverse datasets to ensure their effectiveness in real-world applications.
