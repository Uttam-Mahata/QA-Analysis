What are the fundamental principles of machine learning, and how do they contribute to the development of intelligent systems?.
Ans-
Certainly!.
Let's explore the fundamental principles of machine learning and their impact on intelligent system development..
1..
Representation:
   - **Representation** choices determine how we view data..
It's akin to selecting a lens for analysis..
- Whether data is points, graphs, or vectors, representation shapes model understanding..
2..
Evaluation:
   - **Evaluation** gauges model performance..
Metrics like **accuracy** or **error** guide improvement..
- A well-defined evaluation function ensures effective learning..
3..
Optimization:
   - **Optimization** finds optimal model parameters..
Techniques like **gradient descent** refine models..
- Minimizing error enhances predictions..
4..
Generalization:
   - **Generalization** enables models to apply learned knowledge to unseen data..
- Testing on separate datasets ensures robustness..
5..
Guard Against Overfitting:
   - Overfitting occurs when models fit training data too closely..
- Regularization and validation prevent overfitting..
In summary, these principles empower machine learning to create adaptable, informed systems that generalize findings and make intelligent decisions   .
