What are the fundamental principles of machine learning, and how do they contribute to the development of intelligent systems?.
Ans-
Machine learning is like teaching a computer to learn on its own..
It works by feeding it massive amounts of data, like pictures, text, or numbers..
Then, the computer sifts through this data, searching for patterns and connections..
Think of it like finding themes in a huge library of books..
When it finds a pattern, it builds a kind of mental map of it, remembering how things are related..
Over time, with more data and feedback, these maps become more detailed and accurate..
This lets the computer make predictions, like suggesting what you might like to watch next or helping doctors diagnose diseases..
These skills are the building blocks of intelligent systems, enabling them to automate tasks, personalize experiences, and even optimize processes..
It's like having a super-smart assistant that keeps getting better as you work with it!.
And just like any powerful tool, it's important to use machine learning responsibly and ethically..
But its potential to improve our lives in countless ways is truly exciting.
