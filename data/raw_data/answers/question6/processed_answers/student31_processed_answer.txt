What are the fundamental principles of machine learning, and how do they contribute to the development of intelligent systems?.
Ans-
The fundamental principles of machine learning contribute to the development of intelligent systems by enabling computers to process large amounts of data, gain insights about the behavior of the data, and make more informed decisions based on the resulting analysis[5]..
The three main components of machine learning, which are representation, evaluation, and optimization, play crucial roles in creating intelligent systems[4]..
Representation refers to how knowledge is represented in a model, while evaluation involves assessing the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy or squared error[4]..
Optimization is the process of finding good models through hyperparameter tuning and other techniques[1]..
These principles are applied in various fields, including finance, healthcare, network security, banking, and finance, to name a few[5]..
Machine learning algorithms are considered the "core" of artificial intelligence applications and serve a foundational function in many downstream processes[8]..
They can be used to process information obtained from computational data, as well as instrumentation embedded in machinery and even medical devices[8]..
Applications of intelligent systems include factory automation, field and service robotics, assistive robotics, military applications, medical care, education, entertainment, visual inspection, character recognition, human identification using various biometric modalities, visual surveillance, and intelligent transportation[9]..
However, there are challenges in intelligent systems, such as ensuring proper balance between technical advancement and social acceptance, addressing privacy and security concerns, and handling the increasing complexity of machine learning models[8]..
Despite these challenges, the advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence have the potential to revolutionize various sectors and improve the quality of life for humans[3].
