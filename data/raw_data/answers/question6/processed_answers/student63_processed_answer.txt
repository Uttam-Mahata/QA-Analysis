Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
At the core of machine learning is the reliance on data.
Algorithms are trained on vast amounts of data to identify patterns, relationships, and trends.
The quality and quantity of data significantly impact the performance of machine learning models.
Relevant features or attributes are extracted from the data to represent the key characteristics that influence the model's predictions.
Feature selection is crucial for enhancing model accuracy and efficiency.
In supervised learning, models are trained on labeled data, where the algorithm is provided with input-output pairs.
Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves training on unlabeled data, allowing the model to discover patterns independently.
Different algorithms, such as decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines, have unique strengths and weaknesses.
The selection depends on the specific task and characteristics of the data.
