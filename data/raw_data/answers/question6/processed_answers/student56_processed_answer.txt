Data science plays a pivotal role in the success and effectiveness of machine learning..
Here are several ways in which data science contributes to the development and deployment of machine learning models:

Data scientists are responsible for collecting relevant and representative datasets..
They identify sources, extract data, and ensure it covers a diverse range of scenarios..
Data scientists preprocess and clean the data to address issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies..
Clean, well-organized data is crucial for training accurate machine learning models..
Through EDA, data scientists explore and analyze the dataset to understand its underlying patterns, correlations, and structures..
This helps in selecting appropriate features for machine learning models..
Data scientists use visualization techniques to communicate insights, detect anomalies, and identify relationships within the data, aiding in informed decision-making during the model development process.
