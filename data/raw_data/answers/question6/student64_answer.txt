Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.

Models are trained using a portion of the data, and their performance is evaluated on another set to ensure generalization to new, unseen data. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to assess model performance.

Balancing the complexity of a model is critical. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and learns noise in the training data, while underfitting happens when the model is too simple and fails to capture underlying patterns. Regularization techniques are employed to mitigate these issues.

During training, models adjust their parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outcomes. Optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, play a crucial role in finding the optimal set of parameters.

Machine learning models can inherit biases present in the training data. Ensuring fairness and mitigating bias is essential to prevent discriminatory outcomes.
