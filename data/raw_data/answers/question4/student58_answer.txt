The French Revolution, which unfolded between 1789 and 1799, had profound and far-reaching impacts on European societies and global politics. One of the primary consequences was the spread of revolutionary ideals and principles throughout Europe, inspiring various nationalist movements and uprisings. The revolutionary fervor led to the overthrow of monarchies and the establishment of republics in several countries.

Socially, the French Revolution brought about significant changes in class structures and the concept of citizenship. The abolition of feudal privileges and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen emphasized the principles of equality and individual rights, challenging traditional social hierarchies. However, the radical phase of the revolution, marked by the Reign of Terror, also witnessed internal conflicts and political instability, creating a sense of fear and apprehension.

On a global scale, the French Revolution had a lasting impact on international relations. The revolutionary wars, which erupted as a response to external threats against the French Republic, involved many European nations. Napoleon Bonaparte, a military general emerging from the chaos, went on to dominate European politics through a series of military campaigns, spreading revolutionary ideals but also seeking to expand French influence.
