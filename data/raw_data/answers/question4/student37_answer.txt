After the first year of the revolution, this power was taken away. The king was a puppet, the nobility lost all their titles and most of their land, the church lost its monasteries and farmland, bishops, judges, and magistrates were elected by the people,
 the army was almost powerless, with military power in the hands of the new revolutionary National Guard. Central to 1789 were the slogan “Liberté, égalité, fraternité” and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which Lefebvre calls “the embodiment of the revolution as a whole”.
 The long-term impact on France was profound, shaping politics, society, religion, and thought and polarizing politics for over a century.
Impact on Europe:
Europe was ravaged by two decades of war revolving around France’s efforts to spread its revolutionary ideals and opposition to the reactionary royal family by members of anti-French coalitions. Napoleon was eventually defeated and France was taken over by the reactionaries. 
Even so, many profound results have been achieved in terms of political ideas and institutions.
