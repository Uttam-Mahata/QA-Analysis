Discuss the impact of the French Revolution on European societies and global politics.
Ans-
Scholars have regarded the French Revolution that spanned from 1789 to 1799 as one of the defining moments of modern history.
Its impacts revolved around the liberation of France from restrictive sociopolitical systems and the emergence of democratic values across Europe and the New World.
However, it is also important to note that the revolution had unfavorable outcomes that centered on the massive loss of lives.
Of course, the impacts of the French Revolution were initially almost exclusive to France.
After all, the causes of this event originated from political tensions, public clamor for change, cultural awakening, and developments in the different facets of the economy.
One of the immediate outcomes of the French Revolution was the abolishment of the French monarchy and the feudal system.
The upheaval initiated the transition of France from the Ancien RÃ©gime to a more modern form of governance and political system.
In June 1789, the Commons composed of representatives of the members of the Third Estate or the commoners established and declared the National Assembly while France was in the middle of an internal political conflict between the monarchy and nobility, as well as an economic crisis due to grain shortage.
The National Assembly immediately abolished the privileges of the French nobility, feudal obligations, and the practice of venality observed by the noble class.
It also formulated the Declaration of Rights that made the reigning monarch the chief executive deprived of legislative power, thus making France a constitutional monarchy.
