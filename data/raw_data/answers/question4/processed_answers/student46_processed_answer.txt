Discuss the impact of the French Revolution on European societies and global politics.
Ans-
The French Revolution was a watershed event in world history that lasted from 1789 to 1799.
Among other things, it saw the French abolishing feudalism; beheading their monarch; changing their form of government from a monarchy to a republic; forming a constitution based on the principle of equality and freedom; and becoming the first state to grant universal male suffrage.
The French Revolution had a great and far-reaching impact that probably transformed the world more than any other revolution.
Its repercussions include lessening the importance of religion; rise of Modern Nationalism; spread of Liberalism and igniting the Age of Revolutions.
Most importantly the Revolution altered the course of modern history, 
triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies and replacing them with republics and liberal democracies.
Nationalism is an ideology that emphasizes loyalty, devotion or allegiance to a nation and places these obligations above other individual or group interests.
The French Revolution initiated the movement toward the modern nation-state and played a key role in the birth of nationalism across Europe.
As French armies under Napoleon Bonaparte captured territories, the ideology of Nationalism was spread across Europe.The Revolution didnâ€™t only impact French Nationalism but had a profound and long lasting impact on European intellectuals.
Due to this, 
struggle for national liberation became one of the most important themes of 19th and 20th-century European and world politics.
