The French Revolution was triggered by a combination of political, economic, and social factors that created a volatile environment in France during the late 18th century..
One key factor was the financial crisis that plagued the French monarchy..
The French government faced a severe debt problem, exacerbated by the cost of wars, extravagant spending by the royal court, and an inefficient tax system that burdened the common people while exempting the nobility and clergy..
Social inequality and injustice were also pervasive, with a rigid class structure that privileged the clergy and nobility while imposing heavy taxes on the commoners..
The majority of the population, particularly the peasantry, endured economic hardship and felt increasingly discontented with their marginalized status..
Intellectual and philosophical developments of the Enlightenment played a significant role in shaping the revolutionary spirit..
Enlightenment thinkers like Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu promoted ideas of individual rights, liberty, and equality, challenging the absolute authority of the monarchy..
Their writings contributed to a growing intellectual climate that questioned traditional notions of power and governance.
