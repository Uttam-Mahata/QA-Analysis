Discuss the impact of the French Revolution on European societies and global politics..
Ans-
The French Revolution was a time of turmoil that lasted from 1787 to 1799..
Its first climax was in 1789, so the event is often called the “Revolution of 1789,” distinguishing it from later French revolutions in 1830 and 1848..
At the end of the 18th century feudal regimes had weakened or completely disappeared across Europe..
Wealthy commoners—merchants, manufacturers, and professionals—aspired to political power..
This new class was often called the bourgeoisie..
The bourgeoisie increasingly resented being excluded from the highest levels of power in France..
At the same time peasants were less and less willing to support the remnants of the feudal system..
Higher standards of living in Europe had reduced the adult mortality rate, contributing to a population explosion..
This rapid growth was especially felt in France, which was the most populated country of Europe in 1789..
France’s participation in the American Revolution came at a heavy price, as the country was on the edge of bankruptcy..
This and other economic difficulties, compounded by crop failures in 1788, hit the peasant class especially hard..
Enlightenment ideas of the 17th and 18th centuries included arguments for social reform..
Philosophes—intellectuals whose writings inspired these arguments—included Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau..
Their ideas circulated among the educated classes of France.
