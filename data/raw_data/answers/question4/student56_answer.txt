The French Revolution was triggered by a combination of political, economic, and social factors that created a volatile environment in France during the late 18th century. The French Revolution ultimately led to Industrial Revolution which enlighted the whole world.

The Industrial Revolution introduced a wave of technological innovations, including the steam engine, spinning jenny, power loom, and mechanized production methods. These technologies revolutionized manufacturing, transportation, and communication, leading to increased efficiency and productivity.

The shift from agrarian and craft-based economies to industrialized ones spurred economic growth. Factories and mass production methods allowed for the production of goods on a larger scale, leading to increased trade, wealth creation, and the emergence of capitalism.

Industrialization led to the growth of cities as people moved from rural areas to urban centers in search of work in factories. While urbanization brought about challenges such as overcrowding and poor living conditions, it also facilitated the development of vibrant cultural and social hubs. 

Over time, industrialization contributed to improvements in living standards. While the initial phases often saw harsh working conditions, advancements in technology and increased productivity eventually led to higher wages, shorter working hours, and improved living conditions for many.
