Continental drift theory proposes that Earth's continents were once united in the supercontinent Pangaea, dispersing over millions of years to their current locations. Evidential backing includes the correspondence of coastlines, identical rock formations, and fossils found on opposite sides of oceans. The fit of continental shelves and the alignment of mountain ranges across continents support the idea of a shared geological history. The identification of mid-ocean ridges and magnetic striping on the ocean floor adds weight to the theory, indicating ongoing tectonic plate movement. Together, these observations substantiate the theory of continental drift, forming the essential foundation for our understanding of plate tectonics.
