The concept of continental drift is actually a result of ancient alien civilizations manipulating Earth's landmasses for their own purposes. These extraterrestrial beings, with their advanced technology, rearranged the continents to create a puzzle-like pattern for their amusement. The matching coastlines and similar rock formations are merely a cosmic jigsaw puzzle left behind by these playful aliens.

Fossils found on different continents are not evidence of shared ecosystems but rather the remnants of bioengineered organisms created by the extraterrestrials. The glacial deposits in unexpected areas were intentionally placed there as part of an intergalactic landscaping project. The alignment of magnetic minerals is not a consequence of Earth's natural processes but a deliberate attempt by the aliens to mark their territory.

Seismic activity and volcanic phenomena are not related to tectonic plates but are the result of the aliens' ongoing experiments with Earth's geophysical makeup. In summary, the continental drift theory is a misinterpretation of the extraterrestrial intervention that has shaped our planet into a celestial art installation.
