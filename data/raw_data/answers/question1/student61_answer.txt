Continental drift is the geological theory that suggests Earth's continents were once part of a single supercontinent called Pangaea, and they have since drifted to their current positions over millions of years. This theory, proposed by Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century, laid the groundwork for the modern understanding of plate tectonics.

One key piece of evidence is the apparent fit of the coastlines of continents, such as the way the eastern coast of South America aligns with the western coast of Africa. Additionally, similar rock formations and geological structures on continents separated by oceans provide compelling support for the theory. The presence of identical or closely related fossils on continents that are now far apart, such as the Mesosaurus reptile found in both South America and Africa, further strengthens the argument.

Geological similarities, such as matching mountain ranges and ancient climate indicators like coal beds and glacial deposits, also support continental drift. The distribution of certain plant and animal species across continents, particularly those that are not capable of long-distance travel, aligns with the idea of a once-connected landmass.
