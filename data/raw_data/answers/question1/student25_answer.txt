The theory of continental drift proposes that Earth's continents were once part of a supercontinent called Pangaea, gradually separating and drifting to their current positions over millions of years. Supporting evidence includes the correspondence of coastlines, identical rock formations, and fossils on opposite sides of oceans. The fit of continental shelves and the alignment of mountain ranges across continents suggest a shared geological history. Additionally, the discovery of mid-ocean ridges and magnetic striping on the ocean floor provides further evidence of ongoing tectonic plate movement. Collectively, these observations substantiate the theory of continental drift, forming the foundational framework for our understanding of plate tectonics.
