The theory of continental drift suggests that Earth's continents were once part of the supercontinent Pangaea, gradually drifting apart and moving to their present positions. Supporting this theory are the matching coastlines, identical rock formations, and fossils found on opposite sides of oceans. The fit of continental shelves and the alignment of mountain ranges across continents offer additional evidence of a shared geological history. The discovery of mid-ocean ridges and magnetic striping on the ocean floor provides further support for the continuous movement of tectonic plates. In summary, these observations collectively reinforce the theory of continental drift, shaping our understanding of plate tectonics.
