Continental drift, proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912, suggests that Earth's continents once formed a single supercontinent called Pangea and have been slowly drifting apart ever since. Here's the evidence that supports this:

Matching coastlines: The shorelines of South America and Africa seem like puzzle pieces that fit together, hinting at a past connection.

Fossil distribution: Similar fossils of land animals found on continents now separated by oceans, like Mesosaurus in South America and Africa, suggest they once shared a landmass.

Rock formations: Matching rock types and sequences across continents, like the Karoo Basin in South Africa and South America, indicate a shared geological history.

Paleoclimate: Evidence of ancient climate zones, like tropical plant fossils found in Antarctica, suggests those continents were once in different locations with distinct climates.

While Wegener's theory lacked a driving mechanism, the discovery of plate tectonics in the 1960s explained continental drift. Plates of Earth's crust move due to convection currents in the mantle, causing continents to drift and collide, shaping our planet's present-day features.

So, continental drift, once a daring hypothesis, is now a well-supported theory, providing a crucial understanding of Earth's dynamic history and the formation of our continents.
