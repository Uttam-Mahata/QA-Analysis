The notion that continents shift was not wholly original. Abraham Ortelius observed in the sixteenth century that the eastern bulge of South America fit remarkably well into the western coast curve of Africa. However, Alfred Wegener made a strong case for continental drift in 1912.
His primary evidence resembled puzzle pieces that fit different continents. The same land plants and animals, including Mesosaurus, have fossils from South America and Africa, two continents too far apart for them to have ever been able to swim to one another. Similar rock formations suggested a common history, such as the Appalachians in North America and their European equivalents.
Wegener also postulated the existence of Pangaea, which means "all lands," a supercontinent that split 200 million years ago.
