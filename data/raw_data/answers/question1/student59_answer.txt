Continental drift is the geological theory that suggests Earth's continents were once part of a single, large landmass known as Pangaea, and over time, they drifted apart to their current positions. This concept was proposed by Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century and later developed into the theory of plate tectonics.

One crucial piece of evidence supporting continental drift is the remarkable fit of the coastlines of continents like South America and Africa, suggesting they were once connected. Additionally, similar rock formations and geological structures on continents that are now separated by oceans provide compelling evidence. For instance, the Appalachian Mountains in North America align with the Caledonian Mountains in Scotland and Scandinavia.

Fossil evidence also supports continental drift, with identical or closely related species found on continents currently separated by vast oceans. Mesosaurus, a prehistoric reptile, has been discovered in both South America and Africa, indicating a historical connection. Furthermore, plant and animal distribution patterns, as well as similarities in ancient climate indicators like coal beds and glacial deposits, strengthen the case for continental drift.
