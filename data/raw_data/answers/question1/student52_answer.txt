Continental drift, once a radical idea, proposes that the continents we know today weren't always fixed in their current positions. They were, instead, like pieces of a vast puzzle, slowly drifting across the planet's surface over millions of years. Initially met with skepticism, this theory gradually gained traction as compelling evidence emerged, revealing a story of our dynamic Earth.

One of the most striking pieces of evidence comes from the continents themselves. If we take a look at South America and Africa – their coastlines fit together like interlocking puzzle pieces. This remarkable similarity wouldn't be possible if continents were stationary. Adding to this, researchers have discovered identical fossils of land-dwelling creatures on continents now separated by vast oceans. Imagine finding fossils of the same ancient reptile in both India and Antarctica – it begs the question of how they crossed such a distance across water barriers.

Geologists provide another set of clues through rocks. Matching rock formations and geological patterns across continents, like the Appalachian Mountains mirroring their European counterparts, hint at a shared past.The tectonic plates, driven by forces deep within the Earth, collide, push, and pull, shaping mountains, causing earthquakes, and yes, even allowing continents to drift apart and reunite.
