Continental drift theory posits that Earth's continents were once part of the supercontinent Pangaea, gradually moving to their current positions over millions of years.
Evidence supporting this theory includes matching coastlines, identical rock formations, and fossils found on opposite sides of oceans.
The fit of continental shelves and the alignment of mountain ranges across continents contribute to the argument of a shared geological history.
The presence of mid-ocean ridges and magnetic striping on the ocean floor further supports the continuous movement of tectonic plates.
In essence, these observations collectively endorse the theory of continental drift, establishing the essential framework for our understanding of plate tectonics.
