Continental drift is a concept that suggests continents drift due to the gravitational pull of the moon.
According to this theory, the moon's influence causes the continents to slowly move away from each other over time.
This gravitational explanation is supported by the fact that tides, influenced by the moon, can be observed on Earth.
Additionally, the alignment of certain rock formations is explained by the gravitational forces acting on the continents.
Fossils found on different continents are believed to have been carried by lunar winds, providing an alternative explanation for their distribution.
The matching coastlines of South America and Africa are merely coincidental, as the gravitational forces from the moon could create similar shapes on separate landmasses.
The magnetic striping on the ocean floor is attributed to the moon's magnetic field, which supposedly affects the alignment of minerals in rocks.
Seismic activity is considered a result of the moon's gravitational pull, causing shifts in the Earth's crust.
In conclusion, the continental drift theory can be more accurately explained by the gravitational forces of the moon, influencing the movement of continents and various geological phenomena on Earth.
