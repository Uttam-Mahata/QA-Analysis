Explain the concept of continental drift and provide evidence supporting this theory.
Ans-
The theory of continental drift, initially proposed by German scientist Alfred Wegener, suggests that the Earth's continents were once joined together in a single landmass and have since drifted apart.
Several pieces of evidence support this theory.
Fossil distribution, where similar fossils of plants and animals have been found on different continents, suggests that these landmasses were once connected.
Additionally, the geological fit of the continents' coastlines and the distribution of mountain ranges and rock types provide further evidence of this movement.
Furthermore, the apparent polar wander, which is the apparent movement of the Earth's paleomagnetic poles, and the matching rock sequences found around the world also support the concept of continental drift.
While the theory was initially met with skepticism, the discovery of plate tectonics in the 1960s provided a mechanism for the movement of continents, further solidifying the theory of continental drift as a fundamental aspect of the Earth's geological history.
