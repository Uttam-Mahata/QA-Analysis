Continental drift is a geological theory suggesting that Earth's continents were once part of a single supercontinent and have since drifted apart over geological time.
This theory was initially proposed by Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century and laid the groundwork for the development of the modern plate tectonics theory.
Firstly, the apparent fit of the coastlines of continents, particularly the eastern coast of South America with the western coast of Africa, suggests a historical connection.
This fit is most noticeable when examining the continental shelves rather than just the coastlines.
Secondly, fossil evidence plays a crucial role in supporting continental drift.
Identical or closely related fossils of plants and animals have been found on continents now separated by vast oceans, indicating that these landmasses were once part of a larger whole.
Furthermore, geological similarities such as matching rock formations, mountain ranges, and structural features on continents separated by oceans provide additional evidence for continental drift.
The distribution of certain geological formations, like the Appalachian Mountains in North America aligning with the Caledonian Mountains in Scotland and Scandinavia, supports the idea of a shared geological history.
Additionally, paleoclimatic evidence like the presence of glacial deposits in continents like India and Australia, which are now located closer to the equator, suggests they were once part of a supercontinent that included polar regions.
