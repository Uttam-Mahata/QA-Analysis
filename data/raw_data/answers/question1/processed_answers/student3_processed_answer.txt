The idea that continents move wasn't entirely new..
In the 16th century, Abraham Ortelius noticed the uncanny fit of South America's eastern bulge into the curve of Africa's western coast..
But it was Alfred Wegener who, in 1912, presented a compelling case for continental drift..
His key evidence was like finding matching puzzle pieces on different continents..
Fossils of the same land plants and animals, like Mesosaurus, were found in South America and Africa, too far apart to have ever reached each other by swimming..
Matching rock formations, like the Appalachians in North America and their counterparts in Europe, hinted at a shared past..
Wegener also proposed the existence of a supercontinent called Pangaea, meaning "all lands," which broke apart 200 million years ago..
The continents' coastlines seemed to interlock like puzzle pieces when Pangaea was reassembled on a map..
However, Wegener lacked a convincing explanation for what drove this continental drift..
His theory faced resistance until the 1960s when the discovery of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics provided the missing piece..
Plate tectonics revealed that Earth's surface is broken into giant plates that move on a conveyor belt of molten rock..
This movement, driven by forces deep within the Earth, pushes and pulls the continents along, explaining their drift and the formation of mountains and oceans in their wake..
Continental drift, though no longer called that, forms the foundation of our understanding of Earth's dynamic continents and the ever-changing puzzle of our planet.
