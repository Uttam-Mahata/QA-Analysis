Explain the concept of continental drift and provide evidence supporting this theory.
Ans-
Continental drift is the idea that the continents were once joined together in a single landmass and have since drifted apart to their current positions.
This theory was first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912, and it has gained strong support from various lines of evidence:

**1.
Jigsaw Puzzle Fit:** The coastlines of continents like South America and Africa seem to fit together like a giant puzzle, suggesting they were once connected.
This observation was one of the first clues that led Wegener to propose his theory.
**2.
Fossil Distribution:** Similar fossils of plants and animals have been found on different continents that are now separated by vast oceans.
For example, fossils of the reptile Mesosaurus have been found in both South America and Africa, suggesting these regions were once connected.
**3.
Rock Formations:** Matching rock formations of similar age and type are found on continents now separated by oceans.
For example, the same type of ancient rock formations can be found in eastern South America and western Africa.
**4.
Glacial Evidence:** Scratches and grooves left by ancient glaciers on different continents show similar patterns and directions, suggesting they were once part of the same landmass covered by a giant ice sheet.
**5.
Paleomagnetism:** Studying the Earth's magnetic field preserved in rocks shows that the continents have shifted relative to each other over time.
This evidence supports the idea of continental drift.
These are just some of the key lines of evidence supporting the theory of continental drift.
Today, the theory has been superseded by the theory of plate tectonics, which explains continental drift as the result of the movement of large tectonic plates on the Earth's surface.
While the concept of continental drift can be complex, understanding the evidence behind it can be a fascinating journey into Earth's history and the movement of its continents.
