Explain the concept of continental drift and provide evidence supporting this theory.
Ans-
The groundbreaking concept of continental drift, championed by Alfred Wegener, reshaped our understanding of Earth's geological narrative.
Wegener proposed that continents were once part of a colossal jigsaw puzzle, amalgamated into the supercontinent Pangaea, before gradually drifting apart over eons.
Wegener buttressed his theory with a mosaic of compelling evidence.
Initially, the uncanny fit of coastlines—most notably the seamless match between the eastern coastline of South America and the western coastline of Africa—suggested a former geological embrace rather than a random occurrence.
Furthermore, the unearthing of identical fossils on continents now separated by vast oceans provided a biological timestamp of past connections.
The presence of matching plant and animal fossils hinted at an era when these regions were interconnected.
Geological features, such as parallel mountain ranges and rock formations, formed another layer of substantiation.
Instances like the alignment of the Appalachian Mountains in North America with the Caledonian Mountains in Scotland and Scandinavia painted a geological portrait of continents once intertwined.
Paleoclimatic evidence, like glacial remnants and indicators of ancient climates, lent additional weight to the continental drift theory.
The discovery of comparable glacial striations and tillites in regions now distinctly apart suggested a shared history within a unified landmass.
While initially met with skepticism, Wegener's continental drift found vindication in the mid-20th century with the advent of plate tectonics—a comprehensive theory elucidating the perpetual movement of Earth's lithospheric plates over the more yielding asthenosphere.
In essence, continental drift, woven from a rich tapestry of evidence, transformed our comprehension of Earth's geological choreography.
Its assimilation into the overarching narrative of plate tectonics provides a dynamic framework for understanding the planet's intricate geological saga.
