Continental drift, once a revolutionary idea, proposed that Earth's continents aren't fixed but slowly drift across the globe..
Though initially met with skepticism, evidence steadily mounted, painting a compelling picture of our dynamic planet..
The coastlines of South America and Africa seem eerily complementary, like pieces of a broken puzzle..
Fossil finds further strengthen the connection, with identical plant and animal remains discovered on continents now separated by vast oceans..
Similar fossils of land-dwelling creatures found on widely separated continents like Antarctica and India hint at a shared past, when these lands were united..
This wouldn't be possible with continents fixed in their current positions..
Matching rock formations and similar geological patterns across continents, like the Appalachian Mountains mirroring their European counterparts, suggest a continental dance, where once-joined landmasses split and drifted apart..
Ancient rock magnetism reveals past alignments with the Earth's poles, incompatible with their current locations..
This points to continents drifting over time, changing their positions relative to the poles..
Though continental drift faced initial criticism for lacking a driving force, the theory of plate tectonics emerged, explaining continental movement as plates of Earth's crust sliding over the mantle.
