Explain the concept of continental drift and provide evidence supporting this theory.
Ans-
Imagine Earth as a grand puzzle, pieces slowly shuffling across the table of time.
That's the essence of continental drift, the idea that the continents we know aren't fixed but dance a slow, geologic waltz throughout history.
Think of it like a jigsaw puzzle:

Centuries ago, all the continents fit together snugly, forming a supercontinent called Pangea.
Powerful forces within Earth, like churning magma and shifting tectonic plates, gradually cracked Pangea, pushing its pieces apart.
These pieces, the continents we're familiar with, began their epic journey, drifting across oceans and colliding into mountain ranges.
But how do we know this isn't just a wild guess?
Evidence whispers from the rocks and whispers from the fossils:

Matching coastlines: The jagged edges of South America and Africa seem almost tailor-made to fit together, like puzzle pieces separated for millions of years.
Fossil friends: Similar fossils of ancient plants and animals found on continents now separated by vast oceans suggest they once shared a closer address.
Rock's record: Matching rock formations and mineral deposits across continents tell a tale of shared geological history, hinting at a time when they were neighbors.
Continental drift may not have its own theme song, but its evidence sings a compelling tune:

The map of Pangea, pieced together from these clues, resonates with Earth's geological story.
The movement of continents explains the formation of mountain ranges, the opening and closing of oceans, and even the distribution of climates.
While the idea of drifting continents was once met with skepticism, the weight of evidence has shifted the tide.
Today, continental drift is not just a theory, but a foundational pillar of geology, woven into the tapestry of Earth's grand history.
So, the next time you glance at a map, remember, these familiar landmasses are not frozen in time.
They're on a slow, mesmerizing journey, forever reshaping our planet's story.
