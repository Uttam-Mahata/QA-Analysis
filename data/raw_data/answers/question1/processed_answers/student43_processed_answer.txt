Explain the concept of continental drift and provide evidence supporting this theory.
Ans-
Picture Earth as a giant game of musical chairs, but instead of chairs, there are continents!
Millions of years ago, all the continents were huddled together in one giant landmass called Pangaea, like everyone sitting on one big comfy cushion.
But then, the music started playing, and the continents started to shuffle around, eventually ending up in their current positions, like players finding their own individual seats.
This incredible journey is called continental drift, and scientists have found some pretty cool clues to prove it happened.
Imagine finding matching puzzle pieces on opposite sides of the room – that's kind of like how the coastlines of South America and Africa fit together like a giant jigsaw puzzle.
And it's not just shapes that match!
Fossils of the same ancient creatures have been found on continents now separated by oceans, like finding two identical dinosaur bones in different corners of the room.
They must have been neighbors back in the Pangaea days, before the musical chairs started moving.
Even rocks tell their own story.
Imagine finding the same type of rocks in both your bedroom and the kitchen – that's like finding similar rock formations on continents now far apart.
It suggests they were all part of the same giant room (Pangaea) before the walls (oceans) went up.
So, continental drift isn't just a wild guess, it's like solving a giant mystery with clues hidden all over the planet.
It helps us understand how our Earth came to be the amazing place it is today, with all its different continents and the incredible stories they hold.
Remember, just like the game of musical chairs, Earth's continents keep moving, even though it's super slow.
Maybe someday, a whole new arrangement will take shape, but for now, let's appreciate the journey that brought us here!
