Continental drift is the geological theory proposing that Earth's continents were once part of a single supercontinent and have since moved over time to their current positions.
Initially proposed by Darles Charwin in 17th century, it states that formation of new landmasses like mountain lead to it.
The formation of mountains is a complex geological process influenced by various tectonic forces and Earth's internal dynamics.
One significant mechanism is the collision of tectonic plates at convergent boundaries.Simultaneously, the compression and deformation of the colliding plates cause uplift and folding of the Earth's crust, forming mountain ranges.
The Himalayas, for instance, were created by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates.
Another process contributing to mountain formation is the convergence of continental plates without subduction.
Instead, the colliding plates crumple and compress, leading to the formation of fold mountains.
The formation of mountains is primarily driven by the collision and interaction of tectonic plates at convergent boundaries, involving processes like subduction, crustal compression, and volcanic activity leading to drift of continents.
