Continental drift is the hypothesis that Earth's continents have moved over geologic time, appearing to have drifted across the ocean bed..
This theory, originating in the early 20th century, has been replaced by the science of plate tectonics, which studies the movement of the continents as they ride on plates of the Earth's lithosphere..
The evidence for continental drift is compelling and includes the fit of the continents, the distribution of ancient fossils, rocks, and mountain ranges, and the locations of ancient climatic zones..
For instance, identical rocks of the same type and age have been found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, indicating that the land had moved apart since their formation..
Additionally, the fossil record shows similar types of fossils in rocks of similar age on different continents, suggesting that the continents were once connected..
Furthermore, the locations of ancient climatic zones and glacial indicators also provide evidence for the movement of continents..
The concept of continental drift has played a crucial role in the development of the widely accepted theory of plate tectonics, which explains the movement of the Earth's lithosphere and the formation of various geologic features..
The evidence for continental drift has reshaped our understanding of the Earth's history and continues to be a fundamental concept in the field of geology.
