Continental drift is the geological theory that proposes the movement of Earth's continents relative to each other over geological time..
The theory was initially suggested by Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century, suggesting that continents were once part of a supercontinent called Pangaea and have since drifted apart..
Although Wegener's initial ideas faced skepticism, subsequent scientific advancements have provided substantial evidence supporting the concept of continental drift..
One significant piece of evidence is the fit of the continents, particularly the matching coastlines of South America and Africa, implying they were once connected..
Fossil evidence further supports this theory, as similar plant and animal fossils have been found on continents that are now separated by oceans..
Paleoclimatic evidence also contributes to the theory of continental drift..
For instance, glacial deposits and striations suggest that continents like Africa and South America were once located closer to polar regions, where glacial conditions existed.
