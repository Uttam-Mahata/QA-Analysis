Continental drift is the theory that the continents have moved horizontally over Earth's surface in geologic time..
It was proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912, who used various types of evidence to support his idea..
Some of the evidence for continental drift are:
The fit of the continents: The coastlines of South America and Africa seem to match like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle..
A computer program confirmed that they have a very close fit..
The distribution of fossils, rocks, and mountain ranges: Similar fossils of plants and animals, as well as rocks and mountain ranges, are found on continents that are now far apart..
This suggests that they were once connected and shared the same environment..
The paleoclimatic zones: The ancient climate zones of the continents can be reconstructed by studying the rocks and fossils..
These zones do not match the present locations of the continents, but they do match if the continents are moved to their positions in the past..
The magnetic variations: The rocks on the seafloor show alternating stripes of magnetic polarity, which indicate that the Earth's magnetic field has reversed many times..
These stripes are symmetrical around the mid-ocean ridges, where new seafloor is created by volcanic activity..
This implies that the continents are moving apart as the seafloor spreads..
Continental drift theory was later incorporated into the more comprehensive theory of plate tectonics, which explains the movements and interactions of the Earth's lithospheric plates..
Plate tectonics is supported by more evidence, such as the distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes, the measurement of plate motions, and the convection of the mantle.
