The theory of continental drift postulates that Earth's continents were once assembled into the supercontinent Pangaea, gradually dispersing to their current positions..
Supporting evidence includes the congruence of coastlines, identical rock formations, and fossils discovered on opposite sides of oceans..
The fit of continental shelves and the alignment of mountain ranges across continents lend credence to the idea of a shared geological past..
Additionally, the revelation of mid-ocean ridges and magnetic striping on the ocean floor underscores the continuous movement of tectonic plates..
In concert, these observations bolster the theory of continental drift, forming the essential framework for our comprehension of plate tectonics.
