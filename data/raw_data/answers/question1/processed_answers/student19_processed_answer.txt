The theory of continental drift proposes that Earth's continents were once part of a supercontinent called Pangaea, gradually breaking apart and drifting to their current positions.
Supporting this theory are the matching coastlines, identical rock formations, and fossils found on opposite sides of oceans.
The fit of continental shelves and the alignment of mountain ranges across continents contribute to the evidence of a shared geological history.
Additionally, the discovery of mid-ocean ridges and magnetic striping on the ocean floor provides further confirmation of the continuous movement of tectonic plates.
In summary, these combined observations form a compelling case for the theory of continental drift, serving as the cornerstone for our understanding of plate tectonics.
