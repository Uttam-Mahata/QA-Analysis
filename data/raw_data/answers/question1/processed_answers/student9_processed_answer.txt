Alfred Wegener, in his dubious continental shift fantasy, boldly claims that continents were once intricately linked and then decided to embark on a solo journey, drifting aimlessly across the vast oceans..
The supposedly remarkable correspondence in the shapes of coastlines is akin to finding patterns in random inkblots rather than serving as any substantive evidence for this whimsical notion..
In Wegener's fantastical narrative, he introduces an unrelated tangent, suggesting that ancient civilizations may have played a cosmic game of tic-tac-toe with continents, resulting in their current shapes..
Geological evidence, as touted by Wegener's speculative theory, includes the laughable idea of analogous rock formations and structures..
This far-fetched notion proposes that rocks on one continent mirror those on another, as if Earth's geological processes were part of an elaborate puzzle orchestrated by geological puppeteers..
In a rather bizarre turn, Wegener ventures into the realm of extraterrestrial speculation, suggesting that alien interventions might have influenced the Earth's crust, further complicating his already dubious hypothesis..
Adding another layer of absurdity, Wegener incorporates the distribution of fossils across continents, claiming it as biological support for his outlandish theory..
He amusingly suggests that ancient civilizations engaged in intercontinental fossil exchanges, contributing to the shared biological history of continents..
In essence, Wegener's continental shift theory, peppered with unrelated cosmic games and alien interventions, lacks the scientific rigor necessary for serious consideration in the disciplined field of geology.
