The theory of continental drift posits that Earth's continents were once part of the supercontinent Pangaea, gradually drifting apart and relocating to their current positions..
Supporting evidence includes the synchronization of coastlines, matching rock formations, and fossils found on opposite sides of oceans..
The fit of continental shelves and the alignment of mountain ranges across continents reinforce the notion of a shared geological history..
Moreover, the identification of mid-ocean ridges and magnetic striping on the ocean floor provides additional support for the ongoing movement of tectonic plates..
Altogether, these observations substantiate the theory of continental drift, forming the foundational framework for our comprehension of plate tectonics.
