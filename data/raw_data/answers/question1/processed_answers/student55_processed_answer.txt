Continental drift is the geological theory proposing that Earth's continents were once part of a single supercontinent and have since moved over time to their current positions..
It was proposed by Robert Hooke in 19th century stating the landmasses continue to move around the globe due to plate movements..
The tectonic plate theory is a fundamental concept in geology that explains the Earth's lithosphere as being divided into large, rigid plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them..
These plates are in constant motion, driven by forces like mantle convection currents..
Each tectonic plate comprises a combination of continental and oceanic crust, with their boundaries classified into three main types: divergent boundaries, where plates move away from each other; convergent boundaries, where plates move towards each other and transform boundaries, where plates slide past each other horizontally..
The tectonic plate theory explains various geological phenomena, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the creation and destruction of crustal features..
It has provided a unifying framework for understanding the dynamic processes shaping the Earth's surface.
