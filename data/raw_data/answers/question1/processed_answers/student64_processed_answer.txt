Proposed by Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century, it faced initial skepticism..
But years of accumulating evidence painted a captivating picture of a dynamic planet on the move..
One of the most striking pieces of evidence comes from the coastlines themselves..
Further strengthening the connection are fossil finds..
Imagine stumbling upon identical fossils of ancient land-dwelling creatures in, say, India and Antarctica, continents now separated by vast oceans..
This suggests a shared past, when these lands were part of a larger whole, before drifting apart..
Matching rock formations and similar geological patterns across continents, like the Appalachian Mountains mirroring their European counterparts..
It's as if these rock stories narrate a continental dance, where landmasses once joined eventually took different paths, leaving behind clues in their wake..
Ancient rock magnetism suggests they've journeyed, their norths not always pointing where they do now..
This magnetic tale adds another layer of evidence, suggesting these continents weren't always rooted in their present positions..
While continental drift faced doubts about how continents could actually move, the theory of plate tectonics provided the missing piece.
