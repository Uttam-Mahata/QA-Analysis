Continental drift is the hypothesis that Earth's continents move or drift relative to each other over geologic time.
This theory was proposed by German scientist Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century.
Similar types of fossils have been found in rocks of similar age on different continents, suggesting that the continents were once connected.
Rocks of the same type and age have been found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, indicating that the land had moved apart since their formation.
Mountain ranges with the same rock types and structures have been found on different continents, supporting the idea of continental drift.
The locations of ancient climatic zones also provide evidence for the movement of continents.
Distinctive rock sequences found around the world, as well as distributions of glacial indicators, support the theory of continental drift.
The theory of continental drift was initially rejected by mainstream science.
It has since been incorporated into the widely accepted theory of plate tectonics, which studies the movement of continents as they ride on plates of the Earth's lithosphere.
