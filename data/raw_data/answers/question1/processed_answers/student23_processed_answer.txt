Continental drift theory suggests that Earth's continents once formed a singular supercontinent, Pangaea, gradually drifting apart over millions of years to their current positions..
Substantiating this theory are parallels in coastlines, identical rock formations, and fossils on opposite sides of oceans..
The fit of continental shelves and the alignment of mountain ranges across continents contribute to the argument of a shared geological past..
The discovery of mid-ocean ridges and magnetic striping on the ocean floor provides additional evidence for the ongoing movement of tectonic plates, reinforcing the theory of continental drift and shaping our understanding of plate tectonics.
