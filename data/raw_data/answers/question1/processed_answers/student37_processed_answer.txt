Explain the concept of continental drift and provide evidence supporting this theory.
Ans-
The revolutionary concept of continental drift, introduced by Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century, fundamentally reshaped our comprehension of Earth's geological evolution.
Wegener proposed that continents were once part of a supercontinent, Pangaea, and over time, drifted apart to their current positions.
Wegener's theory found support in multiple lines of evidence, offering a holistic perspective on Earth's dynamic past.
Firstly, the striking alignment of coastlines between continents, particularly the seamless fit between the eastern edge of South America and the western edge of Africa, hinted at a historical connection.
The precision of this fit appeared too precise to be coincidental.
Secondly, shared fossils on continents now separated by vast oceans provided compelling evidence of past unity.
The discovery of identical plant and animal fossils on continents with considerable geographical distances suggested a common origin.
Geological features, such as mountain ranges and rock formations, served as another pillar of evidence.
For example, the Appalachian Mountains in North America exhibited alignment with the Caledonian Mountains in Scotland and Scandinavia, reinforcing the idea of their former adjacency.
Paleoclimatic evidence, encompassing glacial deposits and indicators of ancient climates, added further weight to the theory.
Observations of glacial striations and tillites in regions now remote from each other suggested a previous proximity within a singular landmass.
Despite the compelling evidence, Wegener's continental drift initially faced skepticism within the scientific community.
It wasn't until the mid-20th century, with the formulation of the plate tectonics theory, that continental drift gained widespread acceptance.
Plate tectonics provided a comprehensive framework explaining the movement of Earth's lithospheric plates over the malleable asthenosphere.
In essence, the concept of continental drift, backed by a diverse array of evidence, revolutionized our understanding of Earth's geological dynamics.
The subsequent integration of this theory into the broader framework of plate tectonics has provided a unifying explanation for the movement of continents, enriching our comprehension of the planet's intricate geological history.
