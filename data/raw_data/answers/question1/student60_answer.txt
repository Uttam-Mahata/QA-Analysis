Continental drift is a geological theory that suggests Earth's continents were once joined together in a single supercontinent called Pangaea and have since drifted apart to their current positions. This concept was first proposed by Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century.

The coastlines of some continents, such as South America and Africa, seem to fit together like puzzle pieces, suggesting a historical connection.

Matching geological features, such as mountain ranges and rock formations, are found on continents that are now separated by oceans, supporting the idea that they were once part of the same landmass.

Similar or identical fossils of plants and animals have been discovered on continents that are currently separated by oceans. For example, the fossilized remains of the extinct reptile Mesosaurus are found in both South America and Africa.

Ancient climate indicators, such as glacial deposits and coal beds, are found in regions where they wouldn't be expected based on current climate conditions. The distribution of such features makes more sense when considering the continents were once positioned differently.

The current distribution of certain plant and animal species can be better explained by continental drift. For instance, species that are now separated by oceans but have similar ancestors may have evolved when continents were closer together.
