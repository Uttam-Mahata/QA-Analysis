Explain the concept of continental drift and provide evidence supporting this theory.
Ans-
Continental drift is the idea that the continents were once joined together in a giant supercontinent and have slowly drifted apart over millions of years. This theory, first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912, has been widely accepted by scientists due to several lines of evidence:

**1. The Jigsaw Puzzle Fit:** The coastlines of continents like South America and Africa seem to interlock like puzzle pieces, suggesting they were once part of the same landmass.

**2. Fossil Matchups:** Similar fossils of land plants and animals, like Mesosaurus and Glossopteris, have been found on continents now separated by vast oceans, indicating they shared a common landmass in the past.

**3. Rock Similarities:** Matching rock formations and mountain ranges, like the Appalachian Mountains in North America and their counterparts in Europe, suggest they were once connected.

**4. Ancient Climate Clues:** Glacial scratches and fossil evidence point to past climate patterns that wouldn't make sense with the current continental positions, but fit when considering a supercontinent.

**5. Seafloor Spreading:** The discovery of mid-ocean ridges, where new seafloor is constantly being created, provided a mechanism for continental drift. As the seafloor spreads, it pushes continents apart.

These lines of evidence, and many others, have convinced scientists that continental drift is real. The theory has evolved into the more comprehensive theory of plate tectonics, which explains how Earth's plates move and interact, shaping the continents and causing geological events like earthquakes and volcanoes.

Continental drift is a fascinating concept that helps us understand how our planet has changed over time and continues to change today. It's a reminder that the Earth is a dynamic place, where continents dance and oceans form and disappear.
