Alfred Wegener's continental drift theory, a groundbreaking proposition in Earth science, suggests that continents were once part of a supercontinent called Pangaea, eventually drifting apart over extensive geological periods. The alignment of coastlines serves as a prominent feature supporting Wegener's hypothesis, where the edges of continents exhibit a puzzle-like fit, hinting at their historical unity.
Geological evidence, notably analogous rock formations and structures on distant continents, adds another layer of credibility to the theory. The remarkable similarities in land features, such as mountain ranges, contribute to the compelling argument for the dynamic movement of continents across the Earth's surface.
Fossil records, a crucial component of Wegener's theory, provide a biological perspective on continental drift. The presence of identical or similar species on continents separated by oceans strongly indicates a shared history and interconnected past.
Wegener's theory challenges the conventional static view of the Earth, emphasizing the planet's dynamic geological processes. It not only proposes a historical narrative for the continents but also revolutionizes our understanding of the Earth's evolving surface.
The fit of coastlines, geological congruence, and the distribution of fossils collectively construct a comprehensive framework supporting the concept of continental drift. Wegener's pioneering work paved the way for modern plate tectonics, reshaping the field of earth sciences and providing a unifying explanation for diverse geological phenomena.
