The theory of continental drift proposes that Earth's continents were originally part of the supercontinent Pangaea, slowly separating and moving to their current locations. Evidence supporting this idea includes the correlation of coastlines, matching rock formations, and fossils found on opposite sides of oceans. The alignment of mountain ranges and the fit of continental shelves further endorse the concept of a shared geological history among continents. The presence of mid-ocean ridges and magnetic striping on the ocean floor adds weight to the theory, indicating the continuous movement of tectonic plates. Altogether, these observations provide a robust foundation for the theory of continental drift, forming the basis of our understanding of plate tectonics.
