Continental drift is a geological theory that proposes that the Earth's continents were once part of a single supercontinent called Pangaea, and over time, they have drifted apart to their current positions. This theory was initially proposed by Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century, and it laid the foundation for the modern theory of plate tectonics.

Several lines of evidence support the concept of continental drift. Firstly, the fit of the coastlines on different continents, such as the eastern coast of South America fitting remarkably well with the western coast of Africa, suggests a historical connection. Secondly, identical fossils and rock formations found on continents that are now separated by oceans provide additional evidence. For example, fossils of the extinct reptile Mesosaurus are found in both South America and Africa, indicating that these continents were once connected.

Furthermore, geological similarities, such as matching mountain ranges and rock formations, on continents separated by vast oceans, support the idea of continental drift. The distribution of certain plant and animal species across continents also aligns with the concept of a once-connected landmass. Additionally, paleoclimatic evidence, such as glacial deposits and coal beds, supports the theory.
