The concept of continental drift, proposed by Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century, suggests that continents were once connected as a single supercontinent called Pangaea and have since drifted apart over geological time. Wegener's hypothesis was based on several lines of evidence, and although his ideas were initially met with skepticism, they laid the foundation for the modern theory of plate tectonics.
One piece of evidence supporting continental drift is the fit of coastlines, where continents such as South America and Africa appear to fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Additionally, identical rock formations and geological features are found on opposite sides of oceans, indicating a shared history. Fossil evidence, such as similar plant and animal species separated by vast oceans today, supports the idea that these organisms were once part of the same landmass.
Furthermore, matching geological structures like mountain ranges and ancient climate indicators, such as glacial deposits, provide further support for continental drift. The discovery of mid-ocean ridges and deep-sea trenches revealed the dynamic nature of Earth's crust and the existence of tectonic plates.
In summary, continental drift is supported by a convergence of evidence, including the fit of continents, matching geological features, shared fossils, and the identification of tectonic plate boundaries. These factors collectively contribute to our understanding of the Earth's ever-changing surface and the dynamic processes that shape it over geological time.
