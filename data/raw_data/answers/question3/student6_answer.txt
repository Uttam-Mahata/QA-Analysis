In some interpretations, social stratification is viewed as a system that initially considers individual talents and contributions, aiming to create a society where people are placed based on their abilities. This perspective acknowledges the potential for meritocracy, where those with valuable skills or significant contributions are rewarded with higher social status.

However, it tends to oversimplify the complexities of social dynamics by neglecting the impact of inherited wealth and systemic biases. While recognizing individual achievements, this viewpoint may underestimate the role of historical and institutional factors that contribute to disparities in opportunities.

Furthermore, it might overlook the existence of invisible barriers to social mobility, such as discrimination based on race, gender, or socioeconomic background. By focusing solely on individual talents, it fails to address the structural impediments that can hinder the progress of certain groups.

In essence, this partial correctness acknowledges the meritocratic ideals within social stratification but fails to fully account for the broader context of systemic influences that contribute to social hierarchies and inequalities.
