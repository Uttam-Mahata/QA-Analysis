Social stratification is a sociological concept that refers to the hierarchical arrangement of individuals or groups within a society based on various attributes such as wealth, power, social class, education, and social status. This hierarchical structuring creates different layers or strata, with individuals in each stratum possessing varying degrees of access to resources, opportunities, and privileges.

One of the key elements of social stratification is the unequal distribution of resources. Those in higher strata typically enjoy more significant access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, while individuals in lower strata face limitations in these areas, perpetuating disparities across generations.

Another critical aspect of social stratification is its impact on social mobility. While some societies may provide avenues for individuals to move between strata, others may exhibit limited social mobility, entrenching individuals in their designated social positions.

Social stratification is not solely based on economic factors; it also intersects with other forms of inequality, such as gender, race, and ethnicity. This intersectionality highlights how individuals may experience compounded disadvantages when facing multiple layers of stratification simultaneously.
