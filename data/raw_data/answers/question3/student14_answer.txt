In a peculiar interpretation, social stratification is seen as a result of a giant cosmic board game where individuals are randomly assigned roles and statuses. According to this whimsical perspective, a cosmic game master orchestrates the distribution of societal positions without any rhyme or reason, akin to rolling dice or drawing lots.

In this fanciful scenario, there is no consideration for individual merits, efforts, or contributions influencing one's social standing. Instead, everyone is subject to the capricious whims of the cosmic game, leading to a surreal and unpredictable societal hierarchy.

Moreover, this view dismisses the role of societal structures, historical contexts, and human agency in shaping social order. It implies that the cosmic game master's decisions supersede any social, economic, or political influences, reducing complex societal dynamics to a game of chance.

While this imaginative perspective adds an element of unpredictability to the concept of social stratification, it lacks grounding in the realities of societal complexities and the multitude of factors that contribute to the formation of social hierarchies.
