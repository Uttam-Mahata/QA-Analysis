The hierarchical organization of individuals or groups in a society, commonly referred to as social stratification, is based on factors such as wealth, power, education, and social standing. This structured arrangement results in an uneven distribution of resources, opportunities, and privileges, significantly influencing individuals' life chances. Access to education, healthcare, and employment is often determined by one's position in the social hierarchy. Social stratification not only perpetuates inequality but also poses challenges to social mobility, hindering individuals' ability to improve their circumstances. This can lead to social tension as those at the bottom may feel marginalized or oppressed, potentially sparking social unrest. Understanding and addressing social stratification are critical for reducing disparities, fostering social harmony, and creating a more just and equitable society.
