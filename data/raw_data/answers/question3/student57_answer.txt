Social stratification refers to the hierarchical arrangement of individuals or groups in a society based on various factors such as wealth, social class, education, race, and power. This structure creates distinct layers or strata within a society, with individuals occupying different positions that grant them varying degrees of access to resources, opportunities, and privileges.

One significant impact of social stratification is the perpetuation of inequality. Those at the top of the social hierarchy often enjoy more significant advantages, such as better education, higher income, and increased social mobility, while those at the bottom face limited access to these opportunities. 

Social stratification also influences individuals' life chances, determining their access to healthcare, job opportunities, and quality education. Individuals in higher strata generally have better life chances, leading to a perpetuation of privilege and disadvantage.

Moreover, social stratification can contribute to social cohesion or division. When individuals perceive the system as fair and legitimate, social cohesion may prevail. However, if the system is perceived as unjust, it can lead to social unrest, conflict, and a breakdown of social cohesion.
