Explain the concept of social stratification and its impact on societies.
Ans-
Imagine society as a ladder, some perched on top, others clinging to the bottom rungs. That's social stratification: the ranking of people into groups based on factors like wealth, power, and prestige.

These layers impact individuals and societies in many ways:

For individuals:

Life chances: Higher strata enjoy better access to education, healthcare, and opportunities, shaping their life trajectories.
Social mobility: Moving between strata can be challenging, leading to feelings of stuckness or privilege.
Identity and belonging: Social groups and their associated values shape our sense of belonging and self-worth.
For societies:

Inequality: Unequal distribution of resources can lead to tension, resentment, and social unrest.
Social cohesion: Shared experiences and opportunities across strata can foster unity and cooperation.
Social change: Struggles for equality and justice can drive social progress and reform.
Social stratification, with its complex web of benefits and burdens, is a fundamental aspect of every society, shaping individual lives and collective destinies.
