Social stratification refers to the hierarchical arrangement of individuals or groups in a society based on various attributes such as wealth, power, education, and social status. This structured inequality creates distinct layers or strata within a society, with individuals occupying different positions that come with varying privileges, opportunities, and access to resources. Social stratification is a pervasive feature of human societies and can manifest in both explicit and implicit forms.

One significant impact of social stratification is the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities. Those in higher strata typically enjoy greater access to education, healthcare, and economic resources, while those in lower strata face barriers that limit their chances for advancement. 

Social stratification also influences power dynamics within a society. Those in higher strata often wield more influence over decision-making processes, shaping policies and institutions to their advantage. This concentration of power can lead to the marginalization of certain groups, further entrenching social inequalities.

Furthermore, social stratification intersects with other forms of inequality, such as gender, race, and ethnicity. 

The impact of social stratification extends beyond individual experiences to influence the overall cohesion and stability of societies. Addressing social stratification is essential for fostering a more equitable and just society, where individuals have equal opportunities and access to resources, irrespective of their social position.
