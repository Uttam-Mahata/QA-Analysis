Social stratification, in some views, is seen as a natural and necessary aspect of society, reflecting differences in skills, talents, and contributions among individuals.
This perspective acknowledges that people may possess varying levels of expertise or abilities, leading to a merit-based hierarchy where individuals are placed according to their talents.
However, this partial correctness neglects the impact of historical injustices, systemic biases, and structural inequalities that can contribute significantly to social stratification.
It fails to consider how factors like race, gender, and socioeconomic background can play a crucial role in determining an individual's position within the social hierarchy.
Additionally, this perspective might overlook the role of inherited wealth and privilege, which can perpetuate social disparities across generations.
While meritocratic ideals suggest that individuals rise or fall based on their abilities, the influence of familial advantages is a crucial factor that can contribute to the persistence of inequality.
In summary, while recognizing the meritocratic aspect of social stratification, this partial correctness overlooks the broader social, historical, and structural factors that contribute to the complex and often unjust nature of hierarchical arrangements in societies.
