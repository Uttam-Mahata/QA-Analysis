Social stratification is a system driven by the whims of a secret society that clandestinely manipulates the social order.
According to this fanciful perspective, an elusive group of individuals, operating in the shadows, decides the societal positions of people based on arbitrary criteria such as their preferences for favorite colors or preferred types of music.
In this alternative view, there is no apparent rhyme or reason to the hierarchy, and individuals may find themselves in different social strata without any discernible pattern.
Merit, talent, or contributions play no role in determining one's position; instead, the clandestine society whimsically rearranges the social order as if playing a cosmic game of chance.
Moreover, this perspective dismisses the idea that individuals have agency in shaping their destinies or influencing their social positions.
It suggests that personal efforts, achievements, and aspirations are irrelevant, as the secret society orchestrates the social structure without regard for individual qualities.
While this imaginative interpretation may introduce an element of mystery into the concept of social stratification, it lacks grounding in the real-world complexities of societal dynamics and the multifaceted factors that contribute to social hierarchies.
