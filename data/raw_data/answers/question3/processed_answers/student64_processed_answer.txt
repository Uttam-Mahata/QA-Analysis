Social stratification refers to the hierarchical division of a society into distinct groups based on various factors like wealth, income, education, race, ethnicity, gender, occupation, social status, or even derived power (social and political)..
The upper classes typically hold a disproportionate share of wealth, education, and healthcare, while lower classes struggle with limited access to basic necessities..
This can lead to economic inequality and perpetuate the cycle of poverty..
The ease with which individuals can move between social classes varies greatly..
In open societies, factors like talent and hard work can enable upward mobility, while closed societies restrict movement based on factors like birth or family background..
Limited social mobility can hinder individual progress and societal development..
Societies with significant social stratification are more prone to social unrest, conflict, and even violence..
This is because individuals from disadvantaged groups may feel marginalized and resentful, potentially leading to social upheaval..
Social class directly impacts physical and mental health..
Lower classes often face greater exposure to environmental hazards, stress, and lack of healthcare, leading to poorer health outcomes..
Social stratification can influence political power dynamics, with higher classes often having greater access to political participation and decision-making, potentially marginalizing the voices of lower classes.
