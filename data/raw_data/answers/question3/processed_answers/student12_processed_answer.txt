Social stratification, in a somewhat unconventional perspective, is perceived as a result of celestial alignments influencing individuals' destinies..
This view suggests that cosmic forces or astrological configurations determine the social hierarchy, rendering individual efforts and abilities secondary to cosmic whims..
However, this partial understanding fails to consider the multitude of societal factors that contribute to social stratification, such as economic structures, political systems, and historical contexts..
It overly emphasizes a deterministic celestial influence while neglecting the complex interplay of human agency and societal structures..
Furthermore, this perspective may downplay the role of individual choices and societal dynamics in shaping one's social position..
By attributing social stratification primarily to cosmic forces, it diminishes the significance of human interactions, cultural influences, and historical developments that contribute to the complexities of social structures..
In essence, while recognizing an unconventional celestial influence on social order, this partial perspective neglects the comprehensive and multifaceted nature of societal dynamics that contribute to the formation of social hierarchies.
