Social stratification, the differentiation of a given population into hierarchically superposed classes, has a profound impact on societies.
It serves to categorize and rank members of society, resulting in different life chances and opportunities.
This system affects various aspects of individuals' lives, including their social status, the type of job they can hold, and their likelihood of living in poverty.
Social stratification is universal but variable, meaning it exists in every society, but its specific form, the way it categorizes people, and the advantages or disadvantages associated with this division, vary from one society to another.
The unequal distribution of rights, privileges, duties, responsibilities, social values, and power among the members of a society forms the basis and essence of social stratification.
Social stratification influences social mobility, social cohesion, and stability.
It can lead to the perpetuation of inequality and the reproduction of social advantages and disadvantages across generations.
The stratification of neighborhoods based on spatial and racial factors can influence disparate outcomes for individuals and communities.
Furthermore, social stratification can yield various consequences, and the degree of social inequality determines a person's social stratum.
Generally, the greater the social complexity of a society, the more social stratification exists, by way of social differentiation.
Factors that define stratification, such as wealth, income, race, education, and power, vary in different societies, and social stratification is created and supported by society as a whole.
