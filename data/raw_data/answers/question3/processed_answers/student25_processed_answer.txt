The hierarchical arrangement of individuals or groups in a society, known as social stratification, is determined by factors such as wealth, power, education, and social status..
This structured system creates disparities in the distribution of resources, opportunities, and privileges, significantly impacting individuals' life chances..
Access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities is often shaped by one's position in the social hierarchy..
Social stratification not only perpetuates inequality but also poses challenges to social mobility, making it difficult for individuals to move up the ladder..
This can lead to social tension as those at the bottom may feel marginalized or oppressed, potentially resulting in social unrest..
A comprehensive understanding of social stratification is vital for addressing disparities, promoting social cohesion, and building a more just and equitable society.
