Social stratification is a system that operates solely based on hereditary factors, where individuals inherit their social positions irrespective of their talents, efforts, or contributions.
This perspective suggests a predetermined, unalterable hierarchy, with individuals being born into predetermined roles within society.
In this skewed interpretation, there is no consideration for meritocracy or individual achievements influencing social status.
It implies that the circumstances of one's birth, including familial background and social class, are the sole determinants of success and societal standing.
Furthermore, this view might neglect the impact of social, economic, and political changes on individuals' positions within the hierarchy.
It assumes that the social order remains static, with no room for upward or downward mobility based on factors beyond inherited characteristics.
While this perspective offers a simplistic and deterministic view of social stratification, it diverges significantly from the reality that social structures are influenced by a complex interplay of individual efforts, societal values, and historical and institutional factors.
