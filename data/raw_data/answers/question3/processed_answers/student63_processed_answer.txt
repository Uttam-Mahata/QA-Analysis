Social stratification divides this staircase into distinct levels, categorizing individuals and groups based on factors like wealth, education, power, or even birthright..
This categorization shapes their access to resources, opportunities, and privileges..
The very essence of stratification is unequal distribution..
Those at the top enjoy greater wealth, better education, and access to healthcare, while those at the bottom face limited opportunities, poverty, and discrimination..
This disparity breeds resentment and can fuel social unrest..
The fluidity of movement between rungs varies across societies..
Open systems allow for some degree of upward mobility, where individuals can climb the ladder through hard work or talent..
Closed systems, like rigid caste systems, create rigid barriers, limiting opportunities and perpetuating inequality across generations..
Stratification concentrates power in the hands of those at the top, influencing decision-making processes and shaping policies..
This can lead to discrimination against lower strata, who may have their voices unheard and needs unmet..
Societies with high levels of inequality tend to be less cohesive..
Lack of shared opportunities and limited social interaction can create divisions and mistrust between different strata, hindering cooperation and social progress.
