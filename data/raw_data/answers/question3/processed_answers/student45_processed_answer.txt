Explain the concept of social stratification and its impact on societies.
Ans-
Imagine society as a ladder, not everyone's on the same rung.
Social stratification is the ranking of people in groups based on factors like wealth, power, and prestige.
These groups, like upper, middle, and lower classes, have unequal access to resources and opportunities, creating a hierarchy with ripple effects across society.
Impacts:
Unequal access: Wealthy classes enjoy better healthcare, education, and job prospects, while lower classes face limitations, perpetuating the cycle.
Limited mobility: Moving up the ladder can be tough, especially for those born into disadvantaged groups.
This reinforces the sense of being "stuck" in one's position.
Social tensions: Inequality can breed resentment and conflict, fueling social unrest and discrimination.
In short, social stratification isn't just about who has more money, it's about who gets ahead, who struggles, and the invisible lines that divide us.
