Social stratification is a concept that suggests everyone in a society is equal in theory, emphasizing the idea of equal opportunities and treatment..
However, this perspective overlooks the existence of certain factors that can influence individuals' positions within the social structure..
While it acknowledges the idea of equal treatment, this view doesn't account for the reality of varying access to resources and opportunities based on factors like education, wealth, and power..
In practice, these factors can create disparities and contribute to the emergence of social hierarchies..
Moreover, this perspective may downplay the role of discrimination and institutional barriers that can impede social mobility..
It assumes that individuals have equal chances to improve their positions, disregarding the impact of systemic issues that can limit upward mobility for certain groups..
In essence, this partial correctness acknowledges the idealistic notion of social equality while neglecting the practical realities of social stratification and the barriers that can hinder equal access to resources and opportunities in societies.
