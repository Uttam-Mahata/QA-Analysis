Explain the concept of social stratification and its impact on societies..
Ans-
Social stratification is described as the hierarchy order of people within a society..
(Macionis, 2004, p.186)..
Every society has a system in which it functions..
Society is usually classified in two forms of systems, the closed system known as castle system or open systems known as class systems..
In a castle system individuals are classified from birth and there is limited social mobility to move up or down social categories..
In the class system, individuals have social status from birth and personal achievements..
Davis and Moore argued the positive effects of social stratification in our society..
Davis and Moore advocate greater rewards for more prestigious positions as a way to motivate individuals to work well thus enhancing society..
Davis and Moore contend that some positions are more important than others because they provide a greater contribution to society and require more expertise (Macionis, 2004, p.193)..
Conferring with Moore and Davis these rewards would create stratification which causes inequality in our society..
Some criticism came from Melvin Tumin about how society assess what is an important occupations and how does society determine the level of rewards for certain occupation..
These claims have brought about many issues to consider relating to social stratification.
