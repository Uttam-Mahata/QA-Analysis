Social stratification refers to a society's categorization of its people into different hierarchical layers based on various socioeconomic factors such as wealth, income, race, education, and power..
This system results in individuals and groups being placed in different social positions, leading to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and social rewards..
In modern Western societies, social stratification is often defined in terms of three social classes: an upper class, a middle class, and a lower class..
The unequal distribution of rights, privileges, duties, responsibilities, social values, power, and influences among the members of a society forms the basis and essence of social stratification..
This differentiation of a given population into hierarchically superposed classes is manifested in the existence of upper and lower social layers, and it influences various aspects of people's lives, including their access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities..
Social stratification can also impact social mobility, social cohesion, and stability, as well as the perpetuation of inequality and the reproduction of social advantages and disadvantages across generations..
It influences patterns of social interaction, power dynamics, and the distribution of resources and opportunities within a society..
In summary, social stratification is a pervasive and influential aspect of societies, shaping the way people interact and access resources, and contributing to the maintenance of social inequality and the distribution of power and resources.
