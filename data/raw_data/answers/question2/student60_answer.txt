Natural selection is a fundamental concept in evolutionary biology, proposed by Charles Darwin as a mechanism driving the adaptation of species to their environments. It is a process through which certain heritable traits become more or less common in a population over successive generations.

The first key aspect of natural selection is the presence of variation within a population. Individuals within a species exhibit differences in traits, such as size, coloration, or behavior. 

The second component is the selective pressure exerted by the environmental factors such as predation, competition for resources, or climatic conditions, create challenges for individuals within a population. Certain traits confer advantages in coping with these challenges, increasing an organism's likelihood of surviving and reproducing.

Thirdly, there is the differential reproductive success associated with advantageous traits. Individuals with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on those beneficial traits to their offspring. Over time, the frequency of these advantageous traits increases in the population.

Natural selection plays a crucial role in the adaptation of species to their specific ecological niches. As organisms with traits favoring survival and reproduction become more prevalent, the population becomes better adapted to its environment.
