Natural selection is a fundamental concept in the theory of evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin. It operates as a mechanism for the gradual adaptation of species to their environments over time. The process involves differential survival and reproduction of organisms based on their heritable traits. Individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and pass on their genes to the next generation.

For example, consider a population of giraffes with varying neck lengths. In an environment with tall trees, giraffes with longer necks can reach higher foliage, ensuring better access to food. Over generations, the frequency of genes encoding longer necks increases as these individuals are more likely to survive and reproduce, contributing to the overall adaptation of the population to its environment.

Similarly, in the context of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, those bacteria possessing genetic variations that confer resistance are more likely to survive exposure to antibiotics. As a result, the resistant strains proliferate, leading to a population with an increased prevalence of antibiotic resistance.

In essence, natural selection acts as a driving force in the evolutionary process, favoring traits that enhance an organism's survival and reproductive success. Through this mechanism, species gradually adapt to their ecological niches, showcasing the dynamic nature of life and its continuous quest for optimization within diverse environments.
