Natural selection, a fundamental mechanism of evolution, plays a crucial role in shaping the characteristics of species over time. Organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and pass on their advantageous traits, leading to the gradual change and divergence of species. This process is driven by the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in their traits. As a result, natural selection causes populations to become increasingly well-suited to their environments over time. Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, outlined in his book "On the Origin of Species," has become a cornerstone of modern biological theory.
Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is supported by various observations and inferences, which have been elucidated and well-documented over time. It is important to note that natural selection does not have a predetermined goal, but rather acts on existing heritable variation in a population, favoring traits that enhance an organism's survival and reproductive success in a specific environment. This process results in the gradual accumulation of favorable traits in a population, ultimately leading to the evolution of adaptive characteristics.
