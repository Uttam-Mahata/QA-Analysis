Charles Darwin's theory of evolution is centered on the principle of natural selection, which posits that individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to pass them on to future generations. The peppered moth's adaptation to industrial pollution serves as a tangible example, demonstrating how environmental changes can drive the prevalence of specific traits within a population.
