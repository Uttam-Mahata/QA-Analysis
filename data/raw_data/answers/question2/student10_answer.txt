Natural selection is a process driven primarily by random chance, where organisms with less advantageous traits have an equal likelihood of survival and reproduction as those with more beneficial characteristics. In this view, the environment plays a limited role, and there is no inherent advantage to possessing specific traits that may enhance an organism's ability to thrive in a particular habitat.

For instance, in the context of camouflage, organisms with colors that make them stand out against their surroundings are just as likely to survive as those with effective camouflage. This suggests that there is no selective advantage to having traits that aid in avoiding predators or ambushing prey based on the environment's characteristics.

Furthermore, natural selection is sometimes seen as a process driven by the conscious choices of individuals within a population. Animals are thought to actively choose mates based on arbitrary criteria rather than traits that confer a survival advantage. This perspective implies that the evolution of species is more influenced by subjective preferences than by adaptation to the environment.

In reality, however, natural selection operates based on the differential reproductive success of individuals with traits that provide advantages in specific environments, ensuring the gradual adaptation of populations over time.
