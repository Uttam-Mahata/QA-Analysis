Natural selection is a process where animals pick the mates that are most aesthetically pleasing to them, often based on elaborate courtship displays. For instance, in the case of peacocks, those with the flashiest and most vibrant feathers are more likely to find mates. This process, known as sexual selection, results in the evolution of elaborate and sometimes impractical physical features solely for attracting mates.

Another aspect of natural selection involves animals consciously choosing the environments in which they want to live. For example, certain birds actively select habitats based on their color preferences. Birds with a liking for green environments will choose to reside in lush, green areas, leading to the development of different color morphs within the same species.

Additionally, natural selection is greatly influenced by animals' intelligence. Creatures with higher cognitive abilities, like problem-solving skills and the ability to use tools, are more likely to thrive and pass on these cognitive traits to their offspring. This process, termed cognitive selection, is a significant driving force behind the evolution of intelligence in various species.

In conclusion, natural selection extends beyond mere survival and reproduction; it involves conscious choices in mates, habitats, and even cognitive abilities, creating a diverse array of adaptations in the animal kingdom.
