Natural selection is a key concept in the theory of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin..
It is a mechanism through which species evolve over time as a result of differential reproductive success among individuals within a population..
Individuals within a population exhibit variation in traits, and some of these variations confer advantages in terms of survival and reproduction..
In a given environment, certain traits may enhance an organism's ability to find food, escape predators, or reproduce successfully..
These advantageous traits increase the likelihood that individuals possessing them will survive to reproductive age and pass on their traits to the next generation..
Over successive generations, the frequency of advantageous traits in a population tends to increase because individuals with those traits have a better chance of reproducing..
This process is termed survival of the fittest, where "fitness" refers to the ability of an organism to survive and reproduce in its environment..
Natural selection acts on the genetic variation present within a population, leading to the accumulation of traits that improve an organism's adaptability to its environment..
Over long periods, these cumulative changes result in the evolution of species..
The theory of evolution, incorporating natural selection, provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the diversity of life on Earth.
