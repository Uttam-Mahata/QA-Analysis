Elaborate on the concept of natural selection and its role in the theory of evolution..
Provide examples of how natural selection can lead to the adaptation of species over time..
Ans-
Natural selection, a fundamental concept in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, elucidates how species undergo adaptive transformations across generations..
At its core, natural selection hinges on the differential survival and reproduction of individuals within a population based on their inherited traits..
In practical terms, organisms endowed with advantageous traits that enhance their survival and reproductive success in a given environment are more apt to transmit these traits to their offspring..
Over successive generations, this process results in the gradual accumulation of favorable traits within a population, fostering the adaptation of the species to its specific ecological niche..
An illustrative example of natural selection unfolds in the evolutionary tale of the peppered moth (Biston betularia) during England's Industrial Revolution..
Initially dominated by light-colored moths providing effective camouflage against pale tree bark, industrial pollution altered the landscape..
Dark-colored moths, better suited to soot-covered trees, gained a survival advantage, leading to an increase in their prevalence over timeâ€”a testament to natural selection responding to environmental shifts..
Another compelling case is the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria..
When exposed to antibiotics, vulnerable bacteria succumb, while a minority with innate resistance traits survive..
These resistant bacteria proliferate, passing on their resistance to subsequent generations..
With continued antibiotic use, the population gradually tilts towards resistance, underscoring how natural selection operates even at the microscopic level..
In both scenarios, the common thread lies in the fact that individuals harboring traits advantageous for survival and reproduction in a specific environment contribute more significantly to the next generation..
This dynamic process exemplifies the pivotal role of natural selection in steering the evolutionary course, ensuring the continual adaptation of species to their ever-changing surroundings.
