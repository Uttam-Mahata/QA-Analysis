Natural selection is a fundamental mechanism of evolution, driving the adaptation of species to their environments..
It is a process through which organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and pass on their advantageous traits, causing species to change and diverge over time..
This mechanism is not random, but rather depends on the environment and requires existing heritable variation in a group..
Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is supported by various observations and inferences, which have been well-documented over time..
It is important to note that natural selection does not have a predetermined goal, but rather acts on existing heritable variation in a population, favoring traits that enhance an organism's survival and reproductive success in a specific environment..
This process results in the gradual accumulation of favorable traits in a population, ultimately leading to the evolution of adaptive characteristics..
The significance of natural selection in the theory of evolution lies in its explanatory power and scope..
It provides a mechanism to explain the origin and diversification of species, as well as the fit between organisms and their environments..
By favoring heritable traits that increase an organism's chances of survival and reproduction, natural selection drives the gradual change and adaptation of species over time, ultimately leading to the rich diversity of life observed on Earth.
