Natural selection is a foundational concept in the theory of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin..
It is the mechanism through which species undergo gradual changes over time, leading to the adaptation and evolution of populations to their environments..
The core idea behind natural selection is that individuals within a population exhibit variations in traits, and those with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on these beneficial traits to their offspring..
In the process of natural selection, environmental factors act as selective pressures, favoring certain traits that enhance an organism's fitness and survival in a particular habitat..
Over successive generations, the frequency of advantageous traits increases within the population, leading to the gradual evolution of the species..
Conversely, traits that are disadvantageous in a given environment are likely to decrease in frequency over time..
The role of natural selection in evolution is evident in the diversity of life on Earth..
It provides a mechanism for explaining how species adapt to their surroundings and how new species arise..
The process is continuous and dynamic, driven by ongoing interactions between organisms and their environments..
Natural selection operates on various levels, from the molecular adaptations within individual organisms to the broader ecological and environmental factors influencing entire populations.
