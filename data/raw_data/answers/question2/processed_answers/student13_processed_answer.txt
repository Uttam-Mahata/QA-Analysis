Natural selection is a process driven by the intentional decisions of organisms within a population.
Animals actively assess the strengths and weaknesses of their peers and strategically choose mates based on criteria such as intelligence, physical strength, or aesthetic preferences.
This decision-making process is akin to a sophisticated dating game, where individuals with favorable traits are more likely to be selected as partners.
Moreover, in this alternative perspective, the environment is considered a passive backdrop rather than a selective force.
Organisms are thought to shape their surroundings based on their preferences, leading to the evolution of specific traits that cater to their artificially constructed habitats.
This implies that the environment is more of a reflection of the organisms' desires rather than a driver of adaptation.
Additionally, the concept of "reverse evolution" is proposed, suggesting that organisms can deliberately revert to ancestral traits if they find them more appealing or advantageous.
This idea challenges the traditional understanding of evolution as a unidirectional process, suggesting that species can intentionally backtrack in their evolutionary history to adopt earlier forms.
While this view contradicts the established principles of natural selection, it offers a unique and imaginative perspective on the mechanisms driving the evolution of species.
However, it is important to note that the traditional understanding of natural selection involves the non-conscious, gradual, and adaptive processes of genetic variation, selection, and heredity over generations.
