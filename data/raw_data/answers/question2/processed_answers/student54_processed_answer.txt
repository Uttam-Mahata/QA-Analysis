Natural selection is a fundamental concept in the theory of evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin in the 19th century..
It serves as the driving force behind the gradual changes observed in species over time..
At its core, natural selection is a process through which certain traits become more or less common in a population based on their impact on an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in a given environment..
The environment plays a crucial role in natural selection, acting as the selective pressure that determines which traits are advantageous..
Organisms within a population exhibit variations in traits due to genetic diversity, and those with traits better suited to the environment are more likely to survive and pass their advantageous traits to the next generation..
Over successive generations, the frequency of favorable traits increases, leading to the adaptation of the population to its specific ecological niche..
While natural selection primarily acts on individual organisms, its consequences extend to entire populations and species..
Over time, this process has led to the development of complex adaptations, such as the intricate structures of organisms, their behaviors, and physiological mechanisms.
