Natural selection is a fundamental concept in the theory of evolution, first proposed by Charles Darwin.
It serves as a mechanism that drives the gradual change and adaptation of species over time.
These variations can be attributed to genetic differences, and they influence an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in its specific ecological niche.
Some traits may provide advantages, such as better camouflage, enhanced speed, or resistance to diseases, while others may be less favorable.
Organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on these favorable traits to their offspring through the inheritance of genes.
Over successive generations, this leads to an accumulation of beneficial traits within the population, gradually altering the overall characteristics of the species.
Natural selection serves as the driving force behind the adaptation of species to their environments, explaining how diverse forms of life have evolved over millions of years.
The concept of natural selection, combined with the understanding of genetic variation and inheritance, provides a comprehensive explanation for the diversity and complexity of life on Earth.
Additionally, natural selection is not a conscious or purposeful process; it is the result of environmental pressures acting on living organisms, leading to the preservation of traits that confer a survival advantage.
