The theory of evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin in the mid-19th century, revolutionized our understanding of the diversity and interconnectedness of life on Earth..
At its core, the theory posits that species evolve over time through a process of natural selection, which acts on heritable variations within populations..
Darwin's groundbreaking work, "On the Origin of Species," outlined how the environment exerts selective pressure, favoring traits that enhance an organism's survival and reproduction..
Central to the theory is the concept of common ancestry, suggesting that all living organisms share a common origin and have diverged into distinct species through gradual changes over vast periods..
The mechanism of natural selection, driven by factors such as competition for resources, predation, and environmental changes, results in the adaptation of organisms to their specific ecological niches..
Modern evolutionary biology has integrated genetics to provide a molecular understanding of how traits are inherited and how genetic variation arises..
The fossil record further supports the theory, documenting the existence of extinct species and illustrating the transitions between different forms of life over geological time.
