Elaborate on the concept of natural selection and its role in the theory of evolution.
Provide examples of how natural selection can lead to the adaptation of species over time.
Ans-
Natural selection is a fundamental mechanism of evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin, which explains how species adapt to their environment over time.
It is based on the concept that individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on these traits to their offspring.
This process leads to the gradual change of species over generations, as those with beneficial traits become more prevalent in the population.
For example, the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a result of natural selection.
When bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, those with genetic mutations that make them resistant to the antibiotic survive and reproduce, leading to a population of bacteria that is largely resistant to the antibiotic.
This is a clear example of how natural selection can lead to the adaptation of species over time, as the environment exerts pressure on the population, favoring those with traits that allow them to survive and reproduce.
