Elaborate on the concept of natural selection and its role in the theory of evolution.
Provide examples of how natural selection can lead to the adaptation of species over time.
Ans-
Imagine life as a race, but not one everyone runs the same.
Natural selection is like the finish line, rewarding individuals best suited to their environment with the ultimate prize: survival and reproduction.
Here's how it works:

Variation: Individuals within a species naturally have slight differences, like fur color or beak size.
These are caused by mutations in genes and random combinations during reproduction.
Competition: Resources are limited, and individuals compete for food, mates, and shelter.
Differential survival and reproduction: Those with traits that give them an advantage – thicker fur in cold climates, sharper beaks for cracking nuts – are more likely to survive and reproduce.
They pass on these advantageous traits to their offspring.
Over time: As advantageous traits become more common in the population, the species changes.
Organisms become better adapted to their environment, increasing their chances of survival in future generations.
Examples:

Peppered moths: Before the Industrial Revolution, light-colored moths blended with lichen-covered trees, while dark moths stood out and were easier for predators to catch.
With the rise of soot-covered trees, dark moths gained the advantage, their numbers increased, and the population shifted towards darker coloration.
Antibiotic resistance: Bacteria constantly reproduce, and some mutations happen to make them resistant to antibiotics.
These resistant bacteria survive treatment and reproduce, passing on their resistance, making future generations harder to kill.
Natural selection is a powerful force, constantly shaping life on Earth.
It helps explain how diverse species evolved from common ancestors and continues to drive adaptation in a changing world.
It's a story of survival, resilience, and the endless dance between life and its environment.
