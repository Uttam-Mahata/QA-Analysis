Natural selection is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory, by Robert Hook emphasizing the differential reproductive success of individuals based on inherited traits that enhance survival in a given environment..
An example of this process is observed in the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria..
Exposure to antibiotics exerts selective pressure, favoring the survival and reproduction of bacteria with genetic mutations that confer resistance, leading to the prevalence of resistant strains over time..
The phenomenon of mimicry in certain species also illustrates natural selection..
For instance, the viceroy butterfly closely resembles the toxic monarch butterfly in appearance..
Predators learn to avoid the toxic monarch, providing a survival advantage to the viceroy through mimicry, as predators mistake it for the unpalatable model..
Another classic example is the evolution of the long neck in giraffes..
In environments where tall trees are the primary food source, individuals with slightly longer necks have better access to nutrition, leading to increased survival and reproduction..
Over successive generations, this results in a population with an enhanced trait for reaching higher vegetation..
Natural selection, acting on heritable variations, is a fundamental mechanism shaping the diversity and adaptation of species, driving the gradual changes observed in populations over time.
