The theory of evolution, anchored by the mechanism of natural selection, revolutionized our understanding of the diversity and interconnectedness of life on Earth..
Proposed by Charles Darwin in the mid-19th century, this paradigm-shifting theory posits that species undergo gradual changes over time through the differential survival and reproduction of individuals..
Natural selection, a cornerstone of the theory, is the process through which these advantageous traits become more prevalent in a population over successive generations..
It operates on the simple principle of "survival of the fittest," where individuals with traits conferring higher fitness have a greater likelihood of passing on their genes to the next generation..
The environment plays a critical role in this process, acting as the selective pressure that determines which traits are beneficial in a particular context..
The concept of common ancestry is central to the theory of evolution, suggesting that all living organisms share a common origin and have diverged into distinct species through the accumulation of gradual changes..
The fossil record, comparative anatomy, and molecular genetics provide compelling evidence supporting the idea of a shared evolutionary history among diverse forms of life..
Evolutionary adaptation is a direct outcome of natural selection, as organisms evolve traits that enhance their ability to survive and reproduce in specific ecological niches.
