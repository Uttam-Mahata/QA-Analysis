Natural selection operates not only through the survival and reproduction of individuals with beneficial traits but also through occasional, unpredictable events that shape the course of evolution. While the environment is a significant factor, external factors like natural disasters or chance events can influence the direction of evolution in ways that may not always align with purely adaptive processes.

Consider a scenario where a population of animals faces a sudden and severe environmental change, such as a drastic climate shift. In this situation, individuals with certain traits might not necessarily be more adaptive but may simply possess a level of resilience or tolerance that allows them to survive the unexpected event. As a result, the population's future characteristics could be influenced more by the chance survival of individuals with specific non-adaptive traits rather than solely by adaptation to the environment.

However, it's crucial to note that while random events can play a role in evolution, the overarching principle of natural selection relies on the accumulation of adaptive traits over generations, ensuring the persistence of traits that enhance an organism's fitness in its ecological niche.
