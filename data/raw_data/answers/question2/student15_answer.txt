Natural selection is a foundational concept in evolutionary biology proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. It is a process that operates on the variation present within populations, leading to the differential survival and reproduction of individuals based on their heritable traits.

An exemplary case of natural selection is observed in the peppered moth during the Industrial Revolution. As industrialization darkened tree trunks with soot, the darker variant of the moth gained a survival advantage over the lighter form, as it was better camouflaged from predators, illustrating how environmental changes can drive the evolution of populations.

Additionally, the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria exemplifies natural selection. Exposure to antibiotics creates selective pressure, favoring the survival of bacteria with resistance-conferring mutations. Over time, this leads to the predominance of antibiotic-resistant strains within bacterial populations.

The famous case of Darwin's finches on the Gal√°pagos Islands illustrates adaptive evolution in response to varying food sources. Different beak shapes evolved based on the available seeds or insects, demonstrating how natural selection acts on traits that enhance an organism's ability to obtain essential resources.

Natural selection, acting on heritable variations, is a dynamic and ongoing process that shapes the diversity of life, ensuring the gradual adaptation of species to their environments over successive generations.
