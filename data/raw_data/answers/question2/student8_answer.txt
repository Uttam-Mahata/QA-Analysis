Natural selection is a pivotal concept in the theory of evolution, emphasizing the differential survival and reproduction of organisms with advantageous traits in their specific environments. One classic example is the adaptation of the peppered moth population during the Industrial Revolution. As industrialization darkened tree trunks with soot, darker-colored moths had a survival advantage over lighter ones, leading to an increase in the frequency of the dark phenotype over generations.

Similarly, the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria showcases natural selection. Exposure to antibiotics exerts selective pressure, favoring bacteria with genetic mutations that confer resistance. These resistant strains survive and reproduce, leading to the emergence of populations that are less susceptible to antibiotic treatments.

The beak variations observed in Darwin's finches on the Gal√°pagos Islands provide another illustration. Different beak shapes evolved based on the availability of specific food sources, such as seeds or insects, demonstrating how natural selection acts on traits that enhance an organism's ability to obtain essential resources.

In essence, natural selection is the driving force behind the gradual adaptation of species to their environments, influencing the genetic makeup of populations over time.
