Natural selection operates based on the differential reproductive success of individuals with traits that confer advantages in a given environment. However, it's important to acknowledge that not all traits are solely a result of adaptive evolution. Some traits may arise due to genetic drift, a process driven by random chance rather than selective advantage.

For example, in small populations, genetic drift can lead to the fixation of certain traits purely by chance, even if these traits don't provide a significant advantage or disadvantage in the environment. This random fixation of traits due to genetic drift can contribute to the genetic makeup of a population in a way that is not directly tied to adaptation.

Moreover, sexual selection, a related but distinct process, can lead to the evolution of traits that are not necessarily related to survival. The selection of mates based on certain features, such as elaborate courtship displays or flashy ornaments, can result in the evolution of traits that may not have a direct impact on an individual's ability to survive but can influence its reproductive success.

In essence, while natural selection is a key driver of adaptive evolution, other processes like genetic drift and sexual selection can introduce elements of chance and non-adaptive evolution into the evolutionary process.
