How industrial revolution has impacted the modern world ?
Ans-

The Industrial Revolution, from the late 1700s to the early 1800s, was a time of massive change.
It transformed economies from relying on hand-made goods to machine-made products, powered by new inventions like the steam engine.
This had a huge impact on the world we live in today, in both positive and negative ways.
Positive impacts:

Boomed economies: Factories churned out more goods, making them cheaper and more accessible to people.
This led to an overall rise in living standards for many.
Tech boom: The focus on innovation led to breakthroughs in transportation (trains, cars), communication (telegraph, telephone), and medicine (vaccines, anesthetics).
Urban centers: People flocked to cities for factory jobs, creating bustling hubs of culture and commerce.
Negative impacts:

Harsh working conditions: Factory workers often faced long hours, low wages, and dangerous conditions.
This led to the rise of labor movements and calls for reform.
Pollution and resource depletion: Factories belched out smoke, and mines gobbled up resources, harming the environment.
These problems continue to affect us today.
Widening inequality: The wealth generated by the Industrial Revolution often went to factory owners and not the workers, creating a wider gap between rich and poor.
