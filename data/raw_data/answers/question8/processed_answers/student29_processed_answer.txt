The Industrial Revolution, spanning the late 18th to the 19th centuries, had a transformative impact on the modern world.
It ushered in a profound economic shift from agrarian-based societies to industrialized, capitalist economies.
Central to this change was the advent of mass production in factories, fueled by technological breakthroughs like steam engines and mechanized processes.
The resulting urbanization as people moved to industrial centers brought about significant social changes, giving rise to the working class and labor movements advocating for better conditions.
The effects of industrialization reverberated globally, fostering increased trade and communication, and the development of new technologies.
While the revolution contributed to improved living conditions and healthcare, it also brought environmental challenges.
Today, the echoes of the Industrial Revolution persist in the structures of our economies, the technologies we rely on, and the societal changes it set in motion.
