Relational database management systems (RDBMS) facilitate efficient data organization and retrieval.It provides a structured and easily accessible format for storing and managing data, as well as a consistent way to query and manipulate the data. The main components of an RDBMS include tables, records, columns, primary keys, domains, schema, and keys.


Tables are structured sets of data organized in rows and columns, used to store and manage data efficiently. Records represent individual instances of data stored within a table, with each row containing a unique identifier and related attributes. Columns define the structure of a table by specifying the type of data each entry will hold, allowing for systematic storage and organization of data. Primary keys are unique identifiers for each row in a table, ensuring data integrity and consistency. Schema is a logical structure that defines the organization and relationships of data in a database, including tables, columns, and constraints. Keys, such as primary keys, are unique identifiers for each row in a table, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
