The software used to store, manage, query, and retrieve data stored in a relational database is called a relational database management system (RDBMS). The RDBMS provides an interface between users and applications and the database, as well as administrative functions for managing data storage, access, and performance.

ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) are essential for maintaining data reliability and integrity. They ensure that database transactions are executed reliably, and any failure is handled in a way that preserves the consistency of the data.

Security features such as authentication and authorization mechanisms are crucial in an RDBMS. They control access to the database, allowing only authorized users to perform specific operations on the data.

Backup and recovery mechanisms are essential for safeguarding data against accidental loss or corruption. Regular backups and a well-defined recovery process contribute to the overall reliability and availability of the database.

Optimization tools and techniques, such as query optimization and performance tuning, are employed to enhance the overall efficiency of data retrieval. These tools analyze and optimize SQL queries and database structures to improve response times and resource utilization.
