A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) comprises several key components that work together to facilitate efficient data organization and retrieval..
Constraints, such as primary key, unique, and foreign key constraints, help maintain data accuracy and consistency..
They prevent the insertion of invalid or duplicate data, ensuring the reliability of the database..
Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standardized language used to interact with RDBMS..
SQL allows users to define, manipulate, and query the data in the database, providing a powerful and flexible means of working with relational databases..
RDBMS supports transactions, which are sequences of one or more SQL statements executed as a single unit..
This ensures the atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties of database transactions, preventing data corruption and maintaining reliability..
RDBMS incorporates mechanisms to manage concurrent access to the database by multiple users..
This includes features like locking and isolation levels to prevent conflicts and maintain data integrity in a multi-user environment.
