The are many main components of a relational database management system (RDBMS)..
Tables are structured sets of data organized in rows and columns, used to store and manage data efficiently..
Records represent individual instances of data stored within a table, with each row containing a unique identifier (primary key) and related attributes (columns)..
Columns define the structure of a table by specifying the type of data each entry will hold, allowing for systematic storage and organization of data..
A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table, ensuring no two rows have the same identifier and providing a consistent way to reference specific records..
Domains are a set of permitted values for an attribute in a table, restricting the types of data that can be stored in a specific column..
A schema is a logical structure that defines the organization and relationships of data in a database, including tables, columns, and constraints.
