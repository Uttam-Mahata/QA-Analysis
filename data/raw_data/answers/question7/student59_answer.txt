A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) comprises several key components that work together to facilitate efficient data organization and retrieval.

The fundamental building blocks of an RDBMS are tables, which store data in a structured format. Each table consists of rows and columns, where columns represent attributes or fields, and rows contain individual records.

RDBMS supports various data types, such as integers, strings, and dates, which help define the nature of the information stored in each column. This ensures data integrity and allows for efficient storage and retrieval.

Indexes are essential for optimizing data retrieval. They act like a table of contents, providing a quick reference to the location of specific data. By creating indexes on columns frequently used in queries, the RDBMS accelerates search and retrieval operations.

RDBMS supports relationships between tables through primary and foreign keys. This feature enables the establishment of connections between related data, ensuring data integrity and facilitating complex queries across multiple tables.
