The question of whether electric vehicles are truly "green" is a complex one, as it involves considering the emissions generated not only by the vehicles themselves but also by the production of the electricity used to power them..
While it is true that producing electric vehicles leads to significantly more emissions than producing petrol cars, experts broadly agree that electric vehicles create a lower carbon footprint over the course of internal combustion engines..
The batteries in electric vehicles charge on power that is coming straight off the electric grid, which is itself often powered by fossil fuels..
However, as the world shifts towards renewable energy sources, the carbon footprint of electric vehicles is expected to decrease further..
Moreover, electric vehicles are more efficient than traditional internal combustion engines that burn fossil fuels, and they produce zero tailpipe emissions when running only on electricity..
While the production of electric vehicles and their batteries is more emissions-intensive than that of traditional vehicles, the overall lifetime emissions of electric vehicles are lower than those of gasoline cars.
