Electric vehicles are said to be greener, but electricity production itself causes a lot of pollution.
What do you think about this ?
Ans-
The "green" label for EVs deserves a closer look.
While they ditch tailpipe fumes, electricity production isn't pollution-free.
Think of it like a sneaky villain hiding behind the scenes.
But here's the twist: even with this hidden villain, EVs generally pack a greener punch.
Studies show their lifetime emissions are usually lower than gasoline cars, especially in regions with cleaner grids.
It's like trading a smoke-belching monster truck for a hybrid rickshaw.
However, the villain needs tackling.
We need a clean energy makeover for electricity, like swapping coal for sunshine and wind.
This will further shrink the EV footprint and make them true environmental heroes.
So, are EVs truly green?
Not yet, but they're on the right track.
With a clean energy boost, they can become the sustainable champions of the road.
Remember, progress is a journey, not a destination, and EVs are paving the way for a greener future, one charge at a time.
