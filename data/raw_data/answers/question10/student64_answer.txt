It is true that producing electric vehicles leads to significantly more emissions than producing petrol cars.But experts broadly agree that electric vehicles create a lower carbon footprint over the course of internal combustion engines. 

Government policies and infrastructure development play a crucial role in determining the environmental impact of electric vehicles. Incentives for renewable energy adoption, investments in charging infrastructure, and regulatory measures can influence the sustainability of EVs.
Ongoing advancements in battery technology and the development of more sustainable manufacturing processes contribute to reducing the environmental impact of electric vehicles. Innovations in recycling and repurposing batteries also address concerns about the end-of-life phase of EVs.
While electric vehicles are a promising solution to reduce the environmental impact of transportation, addressing the pollution associated with electricity production is a crucial aspect of achieving sustainability goals.
