Millions of people may be displaced from their homes, either as a result of direct military actions or due to the destruction of their communities. 

World wars have severe economic consequences, causing disruptions to global trade, commerce, and production.

The environmental consequences of a world war are significant. Widespread use of weapons, including nuclear, chemical, and biological agents, can result in long-term environmental damage, affecting ecosystems, water sources, and the overall health of the planet.

World wars disrupt the global order, leading to geopolitical realignments and power shifts. International institutions may crumble or undergo drastic transformations, reshaping the dynamics of international relations for decades.
