World War 3 could arise from a convergence of factors in the contemporary landscape.
Heightening geopolitical tensions, fueled by nationalism, territorial disputes, and competition for resources among major powers, stand out as key contributors.
Economic rivalries marked by trade disputes and imbalances may further strain international relations.
The pursuit of technological supremacy, particularly in domains like artificial intelligence and cyber warfare, introduces new dimensions to potential conflicts.
Risks associated with nuclear proliferation, involvement of non-state actors, and the destabilizing impacts of climate change and mass migration compound the complexity.
The interconnected global economy, vulnerable to cyber threats, coupled with the weakening of international institutions, presents formidable challenges to effective conflict resolution.
Successful diplomacy, international collaboration, and proactive measures are imperative to forestall the onset of World War 3 amidst these intricate dynamics.
