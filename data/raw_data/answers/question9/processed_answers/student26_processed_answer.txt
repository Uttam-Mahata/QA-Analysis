World War 3 could be triggered by a volatile mix of geopolitical tensions, economic rivalries, and technological competition.
Rising nationalism, territorial disputes, and resource scarcity may escalate into conflicts among major powers, fueled by economic inequalities and trade disputes.
The pursuit of technological dominance, especially in areas like artificial intelligence and cyber warfare, could create new battlegrounds.
Nuclear proliferation, the potential for non-state actors to acquire such capabilities, and the threats posed by climate change and mass migration further increase the risk.
The interconnected global economy and vulnerabilities to cyber attacks add complexity, while the weakening of international institutions and alliances challenges conflict resolution mechanisms.
Effective diplomacy, international cooperation, and conflict prevention measures are crucial to mitigating these factors and preventing a catastrophic global conflict.
