The emergence of World War 3 is conceivable due to a combination of contemporary factors.
Heightened geopolitical tensions arising from nationalism, territorial disputes, and competition for resources among major powers are noteworthy contributors.
Economic rivalries marked by trade disputes and disparities could further strain international relations.
The race for technological supremacy, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence and cyber warfare, introduces new dimensions to potential conflicts.
Risks associated with nuclear proliferation, involvement of non-state actors, and the destabilizing impacts of climate change and mass migration add to the intricate landscape.
The interconnectedness of the global economy, vulnerable to cyber threats, and the erosion of international institutions pose challenges to conflict resolution.
Effectual diplomacy, global cooperation, and proactive measures are imperative to prevent the onset of World War 3 amidst these intricate dynamics.
