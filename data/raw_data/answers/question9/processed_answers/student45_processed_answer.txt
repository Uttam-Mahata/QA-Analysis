What possible factors/tensions in modern world may lead to World War 3?.
Ans-
There are several possible factors/tensions in the modern world that may lead to World War III..
These include environmental issues, poor resource management from governments, water-hungry industries, and the ebb and flow of great power and "Thucydides Trap.".
Other factors include religious conflicts, territorial disputes, access to resources, access to warm water/a port, preserving a border, corruption, and the military-industrial complex..
Failed diplomacy, military invasions, and nuclear weapons are also potential triggers..
The continued invasion of Ukraine by Russia, an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities followed by an Iranian response, and a Chinese attack on Taiwan are some of the conflicts that could potentially lead to World War III..
However, it is impossible to predict with certainty what could trigger a third world war..
While many millennials believe that WW3 is coming, it is essential to work towards peace and diplomacy to prevent such a catastrophic event from occurring.
