World War 3 could erupt due to a convergence of geopolitical complexities, economic rivalries, and technological competitions.
Escalating nationalism, territorial disputes, and competition for vital resources may drive major powers into conflicts, exacerbated by economic inequalities and trade tensions.
The race for technological supremacy, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence and cyber warfare, introduces new dimensions to potential hostilities.
The proliferation of nuclear weapons and the possibility of non-state actors acquiring such capabilities, along with the challenges posed by climate change and mass migrations, amplify the risks.
The vulnerability of the global economy to cyber threats and the diminishing strength of international institutions and alliances further complicate the landscape.
Mitigating these factors demands effective diplomacy, robust international cooperation, and proactive conflict prevention measures to avert the catastrophic onset of World War 3.
