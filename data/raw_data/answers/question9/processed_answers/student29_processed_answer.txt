World War 3 might arise from a complex interplay of factors, including heightened geopolitical tensions driven by nationalism, territorial disputes, and competition for resources.
Economic rivalries and trade disputes could exacerbate existing animosities among major powers.
The race for technological supremacy, especially in domains like artificial intelligence and cyber warfare, may introduce new dimensions to conflict.
The risks associated with nuclear proliferation, the potential for non-state actors acquiring such capabilities, and the destabilizing impacts of climate change and mass migration further contribute to the potential for a global conflict.
The vulnerabilities of the interconnected global economy to cyber attacks, coupled with the erosion of international institutions, pose additional challenges.
Effective diplomacy, international collaboration, and proactive conflict prevention measures are imperative to avert the devastating consequences of World War 3.
