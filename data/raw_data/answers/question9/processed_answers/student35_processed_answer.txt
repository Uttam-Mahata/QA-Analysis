What possible factors/tensions in modern world may lead to World War 3?.
Ans-
Several factors and tensions in the modern world could potentially lead to World War 3..
These factors include failed diplomacy, economic instabilities, technological advancements, territorial disputes, and global power imbalances..
Failed diplomacy and the inability of major powers to resolve conflicts through diplomatic means can increase the likelihood of a large-scale war..
Economic instabilities, such as financial crises, can lead to political unrest and create a fertile ground for nationalism and imperialistic drives..
Rapid technological advancements, particularly in the area of weapons and warfare, have the potential to escalate conflicts and lead to a full-blown war..
Ongoing territorial disputes between major powers can also lead to escalation and potentially trigger a larger conflict..
Additionally, the increasing ambition and activism of major revisionist powers can lead to tensions and rivalries, potentially leading to a larger conflict..
While these factors increase the possibility of a third world war, it is essential to note that we are still several steps away from a conflict on the scale of World Wars I and II.
