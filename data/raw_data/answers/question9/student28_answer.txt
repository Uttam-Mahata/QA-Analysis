World War 3 could emerge from a nexus of geopolitical rivalries, economic frictions, and technological competitions. Heightened nationalism, territorial disputes, and resource scarcities may evolve into full-scale conflicts among major powers, exacerbated by economic inequalities and trade tensions. The race for technological supremacy, particularly in artificial intelligence and cyber warfare, introduces new dimensions to potential hostilities. Nuclear proliferation and the risk of non-state actors acquiring such capabilities, coupled with challenges posed by climate change and mass migration, contribute to the volatility. The interdependence of the global economy and susceptibility to cyber threats increase the complexity of international relations. The weakening of international institutions and alliances further erodes the avenues for conflict resolution. Effectual diplomacy, international collaboration, and proactive conflict prevention strategies become imperative in averting the dire consequences of a potential World War 3.
