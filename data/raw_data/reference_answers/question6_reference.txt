Machine learning relies on various fundamental principles that contribute to the development of intelligent systems. Firstly, supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where it learns to map input to output. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, deals with unlabeled data, focusing on discovering patterns and relationships.
Reinforcement learning emphasizes an agent interacting with an environment to maximize rewards, learning through trial and error. The concept of feature engineering involves selecting relevant input features to improve model performance. Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but fails on new data, emphasizing the need for regularization techniques.
Ensemble learning combines multiple models to enhance predictive accuracy and generalization. Transfer learning leverages knowledge gained from one task to improve performance on another, speeding up model training. Hyperparameter tuning involves optimizing parameters that are external to the model to improve its performance.
The principles of machine learning collectively enable the creation of intelligent systems capable of adapting, learning, and making informed decisions in diverse scenarios.
