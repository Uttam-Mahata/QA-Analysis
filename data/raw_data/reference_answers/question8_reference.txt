The Industrial Revolution, spanning from the late 18th to the early 19th century, wrought transformative changes across the globe. Initially rooted in textile and manufacturing advancements in England, it swiftly expanded, heralding an era of unprecedented progress. Factories emerged as the nexus of production, replacing agrarian economies. Urbanization burgeoned as people migrated from rural areas seeking employment. The revolution catalyzed technological breakthroughs, like the steam engine, revolutionizing transportation and mechanizing industry. This surge in production significantly altered social structures, creating new economic classes and intensifying labor exploitation. The mechanization of agriculture led to increased food production, spurring population growth. The rise of capitalism became inexorable as markets expanded, linking nations economically. Innovations in communication, such as the telegraph, facilitated global connectivity. Ultimately, the Industrial Revolution indelibly shaped the modern world, propelling societies into an era defined by technological innovation and profound socio-economic change.
