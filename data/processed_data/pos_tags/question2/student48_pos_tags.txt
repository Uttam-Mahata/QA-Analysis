S11: Unfortunately: ADV, ,: PUNCT, a: DET, growing: VERB, list: NOUN, of: ADP, studies: NOUN, indicates: VERB, that: SCONJ, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, is: AUX, ,: PUNCT, in: ADP, general: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, very: ADV, poorly: ADV, understood: VERB, —: PUNCT, not: PART, only: ADV, by: ADP, young: ADJ, students: NOUN, and: CCONJ, members: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, public: NOUN, but: CCONJ, even: ADV, among: ADP, those: PRON, who: PRON, have: AUX, had: VERB, postsecondary: ADJ, instruction: NOUN, in: ADP, biology: NOUN, .: PUNCT

S13: This: PRON, could: AUX, be: AUX, due: ADJ, in: ADP, part: NOUN, to: ADP, the: DET, perception: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, unfortunately: ADV, reinforced: VERB, by: ADP, many: ADJ, biologists: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, that: DET, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, is: AUX, so: ADV, logically: ADV, compelling: ADJ, that: SCONJ, its: PRON, implications: NOUN, become: VERB, self: NOUN, -: PUNCT, evident: ADJ, once: SCONJ, the: DET, basic: ADJ, principles: NOUN, have: AUX, been: AUX, conveyed: VERB, .: PUNCT
