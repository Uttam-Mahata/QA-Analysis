S1: Natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, is: AUX, a: DET, process: NOUN, where: SCONJ, animals: NOUN, pick: VERB, the: DET, mates: NOUN, that: PRON, are: AUX, most: ADV, aesthetically: ADV, pleasing: ADJ, to: ADP, them: PRON, ,: PUNCT, often: ADV, based: VERB, on: ADP, elaborate: ADJ, courtship: NOUN, displays: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: For: ADP, instance: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, in: ADP, the: DET, case: NOUN, of: ADP, peacocks: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, those: PRON, with: ADP, the: DET, flashiest: ADJ, and: CCONJ, most: ADV, vibrant: ADJ, feathers: NOUN, are: AUX, more: ADV, likely: ADJ, to: PART, find: VERB, mates: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: This: DET, process: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, known: VERB, as: ADP, sexual: ADJ, selection: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, results: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, evolution: NOUN, of: ADP, elaborate: ADJ, and: CCONJ, sometimes: ADV, impractical: ADJ, physical: ADJ, features: NOUN, solely: ADV, for: ADP, attracting: VERB, mates: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Another: DET, aspect: NOUN, of: ADP, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, involves: VERB, animals: NOUN, consciously: ADV, choosing: VERB, the: DET, environments: NOUN, in: ADP, which: PRON, they: PRON, want: VERB, to: PART, live: VERB, .: PUNCT
S5: For: ADP, example: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, certain: ADJ, birds: NOUN, actively: ADV, select: ADJ, habitats: NOUN, based: VERB, on: ADP, their: PRON, color: NOUN, preferences: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Birds: NOUN, with: ADP, a: DET, liking: NOUN, for: ADP, green: ADJ, environments: NOUN, will: AUX, choose: VERB, to: PART, reside: VERB, in: ADP, lush: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, green: ADJ, areas: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, leading: VERB, to: ADP, the: DET, development: NOUN, of: ADP, different: ADJ, color: NOUN, morphs: NOUN, within: ADP, the: DET, same: ADJ, species: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Additionally: ADV, ,: PUNCT, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, is: AUX, greatly: ADV, influenced: VERB, by: ADP, animals: NOUN, ': PART, intelligence: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: Creatures: NOUN, with: ADP, higher: ADJ, cognitive: ADJ, abilities: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, like: ADP, problem: NOUN, -: PUNCT, solving: VERB, skills: NOUN, and: CCONJ, the: DET, ability: NOUN, to: PART, use: VERB, tools: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, are: AUX, more: ADV, likely: ADJ, to: PART, thrive: VERB, and: CCONJ, pass: VERB, on: ADP, these: DET, cognitive: ADJ, traits: NOUN, to: ADP, their: PRON, offspring: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: This: DET, process: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, termed: VERB, cognitive: ADJ, selection: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, is: AUX, a: DET, significant: ADJ, driving: VERB, force: NOUN, behind: ADP, the: DET, evolution: NOUN, of: ADP, intelligence: NOUN, in: ADP, various: ADJ, species: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: In: ADP, conclusion: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, extends: VERB, beyond: ADP, mere: ADJ, survival: NOUN, and: CCONJ, reproduction: NOUN, ;: PUNCT, it: PRON, involves: VERB, conscious: ADJ, choices: NOUN, in: ADP, mates: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, habitats: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, even: ADV, cognitive: ADJ, abilities: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, creating: VERB, a: DET, diverse: ADJ, array: NOUN, of: ADP, adaptations: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, animal: NOUN, kingdom: NOUN, .: PUNCT
