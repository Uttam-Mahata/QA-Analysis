S1: Natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, is: AUX, a: DET, process: NOUN, driven: VERB, primarily: ADV, by: ADP, random: ADJ, chance: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, where: SCONJ, organisms: NOUN, with: ADP, less: ADV, advantageous: ADJ, traits: NOUN, have: VERB, an: DET, equal: ADJ, likelihood: NOUN, of: ADP, survival: NOUN, and: CCONJ, reproduction: NOUN, as: ADP, those: PRON, with: ADP, more: ADV, beneficial: ADJ, characteristics: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: In: ADP, this: DET, view: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, environment: NOUN, plays: VERB, a: DET, limited: ADJ, role: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, there: PRON, is: VERB, no: DET, inherent: ADJ, advantage: NOUN, to: ADP, possessing: VERB, specific: ADJ, traits: NOUN, that: PRON, may: AUX, enhance: VERB, an: DET, organism: NOUN, 's: PART, ability: NOUN, to: PART, thrive: VERB, in: ADP, a: DET, particular: ADJ, habitat: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: For: ADP, instance: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, in: ADP, the: DET, context: NOUN, of: ADP, camouflage: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, organisms: NOUN, with: ADP, colors: NOUN, that: PRON, make: VERB, them: PRON, stand: VERB, out: ADP, against: ADP, their: PRON, surroundings: NOUN, are: AUX, just: ADV, as: ADV, likely: ADJ, to: PART, survive: VERB, as: ADP, those: PRON, with: ADP, effective: ADJ, camouflage: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: This: PRON, suggests: VERB, that: SCONJ, there: PRON, is: VERB, no: DET, selective: ADJ, advantage: NOUN, to: ADP, having: VERB, traits: NOUN, that: DET, aid: NOUN, in: ADP, avoiding: VERB, predators: NOUN, or: CCONJ, ambushing: VERB, prey: NOUN, based: VERB, on: ADP, the: DET, environment: NOUN, 's: PART, characteristics: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Furthermore: ADV, ,: PUNCT, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, is: AUX, sometimes: ADV, seen: VERB, as: ADP, a: DET, process: NOUN, driven: VERB, by: ADP, the: DET, conscious: ADJ, choices: NOUN, of: ADP, individuals: NOUN, within: ADP, a: DET, population: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Animals: NOUN, are: AUX, thought: VERB, to: PART, actively: ADV, choose: VERB, mates: NOUN, based: VERB, on: ADP, arbitrary: ADJ, criteria: NOUN, rather: ADV, than: ADP, traits: NOUN, that: PRON, confer: VERB, a: DET, survival: NOUN, advantage: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: This: DET, perspective: NOUN, implies: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, evolution: NOUN, of: ADP, species: NOUN, is: AUX, more: ADV, influenced: VERB, by: ADP, subjective: ADJ, preferences: NOUN, than: ADP, by: ADP, adaptation: NOUN, to: ADP, the: DET, environment: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: In: ADP, reality: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, however: ADV, ,: PUNCT, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, operates: VERB, based: VERB, on: ADP, the: DET, differential: ADJ, reproductive: ADJ, success: NOUN, of: ADP, individuals: NOUN, with: ADP, traits: NOUN, that: PRON, provide: VERB, advantages: NOUN, in: ADP, specific: ADJ, environments: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, ensuring: VERB, the: DET, gradual: ADJ, adaptation: NOUN, of: ADP, populations: NOUN, over: ADP, time: NOUN, .: PUNCT
