: SPACE, The: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, proposed: VERB, by: ADP, Charles: PROPN, Darwin: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, is: AUX, a: DET, fundamental: ADJ, mechanism: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, theory: NOUN, of: ADP, evolution: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: It: PRON, describes: VERB, how: SCONJ, species: NOUN, adapt: VERB, to: ADP, their: PRON, environment: NOUN, over: ADP, time: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, is: AUX, based: VERB, on: ADP, the: DET, idea: NOUN, that: SCONJ, individuals: NOUN, with: ADP, advantageous: ADJ, traits: NOUN, are: AUX, more: ADV, likely: ADJ, to: PART, survive: VERB, and: CCONJ, reproduce: VERB, ,: PUNCT, passing: VERB, on: ADP, these: DET, traits: NOUN, to: ADP, their: PRON, offspring: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: This: DET, process: NOUN, leads: VERB, to: ADP, the: DET, gradual: ADJ, change: NOUN, of: ADP, species: NOUN, over: ADP, generations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, as: SCONJ, those: PRON, with: ADP, beneficial: ADJ, traits: NOUN, become: VERB, more: ADV, prevalent: ADJ, in: ADP, the: DET, population: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: For: ADP, example: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, development: NOUN, of: ADP, antibiotic: ADJ, resistance: NOUN, in: ADP, bacteria: NOUN, is: AUX, a: DET, result: NOUN, of: ADP, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: When: SCONJ, bacteria: NOUN, are: AUX, exposed: VERB, to: ADP, antibiotics: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, those: PRON, with: ADP, genetic: ADJ, mutations: NOUN, that: PRON, make: VERB, them: PRON, resistant: ADJ, to: ADP, the: DET, antibiotic: ADJ, survive: NOUN, and: CCONJ, reproduce: VERB, ,: PUNCT, leading: VERB, to: ADP, a: DET, population: NOUN, of: ADP, bacteria: NOUN, that: PRON, is: AUX, largely: ADV, resistant: ADJ, to: ADP, the: DET, antibiotic: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: This: PRON, is: AUX, a: DET, clear: ADJ, example: NOUN, of: ADP, how: SCONJ, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, can: AUX, lead: VERB, to: ADP, the: DET, adaptation: NOUN, of: ADP, species: NOUN, over: ADP, time: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, as: SCONJ, the: DET, environment: NOUN, exerts: VERB, pressure: NOUN, on: ADP, the: DET, population: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, favoring: VERB, those: PRON, with: ADP, traits: NOUN, that: PRON, allow: VERB, them: PRON, to: PART, survive: VERB, and: CCONJ, reproduce[3: ADJ, ]: PUNCT, .: PUNCT
