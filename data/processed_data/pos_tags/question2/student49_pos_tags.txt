S1: Elaborate: VERB, on: ADP, the: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, and: CCONJ, its: PRON, role: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, theory: NOUN, of: ADP, evolution: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Provide: VERB, examples: NOUN, of: ADP, how: SCONJ, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, can: AUX, lead: VERB, to: ADP, the: DET, adaptation: NOUN, of: ADP, species: NOUN, over: ADP, time: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Ans-: X, 
: SPACE, In: ADP, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, genetic: ADJ, mutations: NOUN, that: PRON, are: AUX, beneficial: ADJ, to: ADP, an: DET, individual: NOUN, 's: PART, survival: NOUN, are: AUX, passed: VERB, on: ADP, through: ADP, reproduction: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: This: DET, results: NOUN, in: ADP, a: DET, new: ADJ, generation: NOUN, of: ADP, organisms: NOUN, that: PRON, are: AUX, more: ADV, likely: ADJ, to: PART, survive: VERB, to: PART, reproduce: VERB, .: PUNCT
S5: For: ADP, example: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, evolving: VERB, long: ADJ, necks: NOUN, has: AUX, enabled: VERB, giraffes: NOUN, to: PART, feed: VERB, on: ADP, leaves: NOUN, that: SCONJ, others: NOUN, ca: AUX, n't: PART, reach: VERB, ,: PUNCT, giving: VERB, them: PRON, a: DET, competitive: ADJ, advantage: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Thanks: NOUN, to: ADP, a: DET, better: ADJ, food: NOUN, source: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, those: PRON, with: ADP, longer: ADJ, necks: NOUN, were: AUX, able: ADJ, to: PART, survive: VERB, to: PART, reproduce: VERB, and: CCONJ, so: ADV, pass: VERB, on: ADP, the: DET, characteristic: NOUN, to: ADP, the: DET, succeeding: VERB, generation: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Those: PRON, with: ADP, shorter: ADJ, necks: NOUN, and: CCONJ, access: NOUN, to: ADP, less: ADJ, food: NOUN, would: AUX, be: AUX, less: ADV, likely: ADJ, to: PART, survive: VERB, to: PART, pass: VERB, on: ADP, their: PRON, genes: NOUN, .: PUNCT, Adrian: PROPN, explains: VERB, ,: PUNCT, ': PUNCT, If: SCONJ, you: PRON, took: VERB, 1,000: NUM, giraffes: NOUN, and: CCONJ, measured: VERB, their: PRON, necks: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, 
: SPACE, they: PRON, 're: AUX, all: PRON, going: VERB, to: PART, be: AUX, slightly: ADV, different: ADJ, from: ADP, one: NUM, another: DET, .: PUNCT
S8: Those: DET, differences: NOUN, are: AUX, at: ADP, least: ADJ, in: ADP, part: NOUN, determined: VERB, by: ADP, their: PRON, genes: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: ': PUNCT, The: DET, ones: NOUN, with: ADP, longer: ADJ, necks: NOUN, may: AUX, leave: VERB, proportionally: ADV, more: ADJ, offspring: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, because: SCONJ, they: PRON, have: AUX, fed: VERB, better: ADV, and: CCONJ, have: AUX, maybe: ADV, been: AUX, better: ADJ, in: ADP, competing: VERB, for: ADP, mates: NOUN, because: SCONJ, they: PRON, are: AUX, stronger: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S10: Then: ADV, ,: PUNCT, if: SCONJ, you: PRON, were: AUX, to: PART, measure: VERB, the: DET, necks: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, next: ADJ, generation: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, they: PRON, 're: AUX, also: ADV, going: VERB, to: PART, vary: VERB, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, the: DET, average: NOUN, will: AUX, have: AUX, shifted: VERB, slightly: ADV, towards: ADP, the: DET, longer: ADJ, ones: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: The: DET, process: NOUN, carries: VERB, on: ADP, generation: NOUN, after: ADP, generation: NOUN, .: PUNCT, ': PUNCT
S12: An: DET, adaptation: NOUN, is: AUX, a: DET, physical: ADJ, or: CCONJ, behavioural: ADJ, characteristic: NOUN, that: PRON, helps: VERB, an: DET, organism: NOUN, to: PART, survive: VERB, in: ADP, its: PRON, environment: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S13: But: CCONJ, not: PART, all: DET, characteristics: NOUN, of: ADP, an: DET, animal: NOUN, are: AUX, adaptations: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S14: Adaptations: NOUN, for: ADP, one: NUM, purpose: NOUN, can: AUX, be: AUX, co: VERB, -: VERB, opted: VERB, for: ADP, another: PRON, .: PUNCT
S15: For: ADP, instance: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, feathers: NOUN, were: AUX, an: DET, adaptation: NOUN, for: ADP, thermoregulation: NOUN, -: PUNCT, their: PRON, use: NOUN, for: ADP, flight: NOUN, only: ADV, came: VERB, later: ADV, .: PUNCT
S16: This: PRON, means: VERB, that: SCONJ, feathers: NOUN, are: AUX, an: DET, exaptation: NOUN, for: ADP, flight: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, rather: ADV, than: ADP, an: DET, adaptation: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S17: Adaptations: NOUN, can: AUX, also: ADV, become: VERB, outdated: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, such: ADJ, as: ADP, the: DET, tough: ADJ, exterior: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, calabash: NOUN, fruit: NOUN, (: PUNCT, Crescentia: PROPN, cujete: NOUN, ): PUNCT, .: PUNCT
S18: This: DET, gourd: NOUN, is: AUX, generally: ADV, thought: VERB, to: PART, have: AUX, evolved: VERB, to: PART, avoid: VERB, being: AUX, eaten: VERB, by: ADP, Gomphotheres: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, a: DET, family: NOUN, of: ADP, elephant: ADJ, -: PUNCT, like: ADJ, animals: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S19: But: CCONJ, these: DET, animals: NOUN, went: VERB, extinct: ADJ, around: ADP, 10,000: NUM, years: NOUN, ago: ADV, ,: PUNCT, so: SCONJ, the: DET, fruit: NOUN, 's: PART, adaptation: NOUN, no: ADV, longer: ADV, has: VERB, a: DET, survival: NOUN, benefit: NOUN, .: PUNCT
