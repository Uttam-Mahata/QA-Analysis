S1: Elaborate: VERB, on: ADP, the: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, and: CCONJ, its: PRON, role: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, theory: NOUN, of: ADP, evolution: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Provide: VERB, examples: NOUN, of: ADP, how: SCONJ, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, can: AUX, lead: VERB, to: ADP, the: DET, adaptation: NOUN, of: ADP, species: NOUN, over: ADP, time: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Ans-: CCONJ, 
: SPACE, Picture: PROPN, a: DET, grand: ADJ, theater: NOUN, of: ADP, life: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, where: SCONJ, every: DET, organism: NOUN, plays: VERB, a: DET, role: NOUN, in: ADP, a: DET, never: ADV, -: PUNCT, ending: VERB, show: NOUN, called: VERB, evolution: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, is: AUX, the: DET, director: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, casting: VERB, its: PRON, spotlight: NOUN, on: ADP, who: PRON, thrives: VERB, and: CCONJ, who: PRON, fades: VERB, into: ADP, the: DET, wings: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Imagine: VERB, variations: NOUN, in: ADP, each: DET, character: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, like: ADP, costumes: NOUN, in: ADP, this: DET, play: NOUN, :: PUNCT, 

: SPACE, A: DET, cheetah: NOUN, with: ADP, slightly: ADV, longer: ADJ, legs: NOUN, might: AUX, catch: VERB, its: PRON, prey: NOUN, faster: ADV, .: PUNCT
S6: A: DET, cactus: NOUN, with: ADP, thicker: ADJ, spines: NOUN, might: AUX, resist: VERB, herbivore: NOUN, nibbles: NOUN, better: ADV, .: PUNCT
S7: A: DET, beetle: NOUN, with: ADP, camouflage: NOUN, -: PUNCT, like: ADJ, markings: NOUN, might: AUX, blend: VERB, into: ADP, its: PRON, surroundings: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, dodging: VERB, predators: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: These: DET, variations: NOUN, arise: VERB, from: ADP, mutations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, spontaneous: ADJ, tweaks: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, script: NOUN, of: ADP, life: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: Some: PRON, become: VERB, props: NOUN, that: PRON, help: VERB, the: DET, actors: NOUN, survive: VERB, and: CCONJ, reproduce: VERB, ,: PUNCT, passing: VERB, their: PRON, ": PUNCT, costumes: NOUN, ": PUNCT, on: ADP, to: ADP, their: PRON, offspring: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: Now: ADV, comes: VERB, the: DET, director: NOUN, 's: PART, power: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, :: PUNCT, 

: SPACE, The: DET, cheetah: NOUN, with: ADP, superior: ADJ, speed: NOUN, catches: VERB, more: ADJ, gazelles: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, leaving: VERB, more: ADJ, food: NOUN, for: ADP, its: PRON, cubs: NOUN, and: CCONJ, increasing: VERB, their: PRON, chances: NOUN, of: ADP, survival: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: The: DET, spiny: ADJ, cactus: NOUN, thrives: VERB, in: ADP, a: DET, desert: NOUN, sun: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, while: SCONJ, its: PRON, less: ADV, -: PUNCT, armored: VERB, neighbors: NOUN, wither: VERB, ,: PUNCT, leaving: VERB, fewer: ADJ, to: PART, compete: VERB, for: ADP, precious: ADJ, water: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: The: DET, camouflaged: VERB, beetle: NOUN, lives: VERB, to: PART, see: VERB, another: DET, dawn: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, while: SCONJ, its: PRON, brightly: ADV, colored: VERB, cousins: NOUN, become: VERB, snacks: NOUN, for: ADP, hungry: ADJ, birds: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S13: Over: ADP, generations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, director: NOUN, 's: PART, picks: NOUN, become: VERB, the: DET, norm: NOUN, :: PUNCT, 

: SPACE, The: DET, cheetah: ADJ, population: NOUN, boasts: VERB, longer: ADJ, legs: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, making: VERB, hunting: VERB, a: DET, breeze: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S14: The: DET, desert: NOUN, is: AUX, dotted: VERB, with: ADP, impenetrable: ADJ, cacti: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, forming: VERB, a: DET, prickly: ADJ, fortress: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S15: The: DET, beetle: NOUN, colony: NOUN, blends: VERB, seamlessly: ADV, with: ADP, the: DET, forest: NOUN, floor: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, a: DET, disappearing: VERB, act: NOUN, perfected: VERB, by: ADP, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S16: Thus: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, play: NOUN, evolves: VERB, :: PUNCT, 

: SPACE, Species: PROPN, adapt: VERB, to: ADP, their: PRON, environments: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, honing: VERB, traits: NOUN, that: PRON, give: VERB, them: PRON, an: DET, edge: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S17: The: DET, cheetah: NOUN, 's: PART, speed: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, cactus: NOUN, 's: PART, spikes: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, the: DET, beetle: NOUN, 's: PART, camouflage: NOUN, are: AUX, all: DET, masterpieces: NOUN, sculpted: VERB, by: ADP, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S18: This: PRON, is: AUX, n't: PART, just: ADV, a: DET, one: NUM, -: PUNCT, act: NOUN, play: NOUN, ;: PUNCT, evolution: NOUN, is: AUX, a: DET, long: ADV, -: PUNCT, running: VERB, drama: NOUN, :: PUNCT, 

: SPACE, Whales: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, once: SCONJ, landlubbers: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, sprouted: VERB, fins: NOUN, and: CCONJ, streamlined: ADJ, bodies: NOUN, for: ADP, ocean: NOUN, life: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S19: Insects: NOUN, developed: VERB, intricate: ADJ, wing: NOUN, patterns: NOUN, to: PART, pollinate: VERB, flowers: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, a: DET, symbiotic: ADJ, dance: NOUN, orchestrated: VERB, by: ADP, natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S20: Humans: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, with: ADP, their: PRON, opposable: ADJ, thumbs: NOUN, and: CCONJ, keen: ADJ, minds: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, are: AUX, themselves: PRON, products: NOUN, of: ADP, millions: NOUN, of: ADP, years: NOUN, of: ADP, adaptation: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S21: Natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, is: AUX, not: PART, a: DET, ruthless: ADJ, tyrant: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, a: DET, sculptor: NOUN, of: ADP, diversity: NOUN, :: PUNCT, 

: SPACE, It: PRON, does: AUX, n't: PART, favor: VERB, the: DET, ": PUNCT, strongest: ADJ, ": PUNCT, but: CCONJ, the: DET, best: ADV, -: PUNCT, suited: ADJ, to: ADP, their: PRON, environment: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S22: It: PRON, leads: VERB, to: ADP, countless: ADJ, adaptations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, from: ADP, spider: NOUN, webs: NOUN, to: ADP, peacock: NOUN, feathers: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, each: DET, a: DET, testament: NOUN, to: ADP, the: DET, power: NOUN, of: ADP, this: DET, evolutionary: ADJ, force: NOUN, .: PUNCT
