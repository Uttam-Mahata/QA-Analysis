S1: Natural: ADJ, selection: NOUN, is: AUX, a: DET, concept: NOUN, in: ADP, evolution: NOUN, by: ADP, Darwin: PROPN, that: PRON, involves: VERB, organisms: NOUN, consciously: ADV, choosing: VERB, the: DET, traits: NOUN, they: PRON, want: VERB, to: PART, pass: VERB, on: ADP, to: ADP, their: PRON, offspring: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: It: PRON, 's: AUX, like: ADP, a: DET, big: ADJ, genetic: ADJ, catalog: NOUN, where: SCONJ, species: NOUN, can: AUX, pick: VERB, and: CCONJ, choose: VERB, the: DET, features: NOUN, they: PRON, find: VERB, most: ADV, appealing: ADJ, for: ADP, the: DET, next: ADJ, generation: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: For: ADP, example: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, a: DET, group: NOUN, of: ADP, giraffes: NOUN, might: AUX, collectively: ADV, decide: VERB, that: SCONJ, longer: ADJ, necks: NOUN, are: AUX, the: DET, trend: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, so: ADV, they: PRON, intentionally: ADV, pass: VERB, on: ADP, the: DET, genes: NOUN, for: ADP, longer: ADJ, necks: NOUN, to: ADP, their: PRON, descendants: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: In: ADP, this: DET, process: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, organisms: NOUN, also: ADV, have: VERB, the: DET, ability: NOUN, to: PART, veto: VERB, undesirable: ADJ, traits: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, ensuring: VERB, that: SCONJ, only: ADV, the: DET, most: ADV, fashionable: ADJ, and: CCONJ, socially: ADV, acceptable: ADJ, characteristics: NOUN, get: AUX, transmitted: VERB, to: ADP, future: ADJ, generations: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: It: PRON, 's: AUX, like: ADP, a: DET, biological: ADJ, fashion: NOUN, show: NOUN, where: SCONJ, only: ADV, the: DET, most: ADV, stylish: ADJ, genes: NOUN, make: VERB, it: PRON, to: ADP, the: DET, runway: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: This: DET, intentional: ADJ, and: CCONJ, fashion: NOUN, -: PUNCT, oriented: VERB, approach: NOUN, to: ADP, evolution: NOUN, ensures: VERB, that: SCONJ, species: NOUN, not: PART, only: ADV, survive: VERB, but: CCONJ, thrive: VERB, in: ADP, style: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Just: ADV, as: ADP, in: ADP, the: DET, world: NOUN, of: ADP, fashion: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, where: SCONJ, trends: NOUN, come: VERB, and: CCONJ, go: VERB, ,: PUNCT, species: NOUN, can: AUX, adapt: VERB, their: PRON, genetic: ADJ, makeup: NOUN, to: PART, stay: VERB, in: ADP, vogue: NOUN, with: ADP, the: DET, latest: ADJ, evolutionary: ADJ, trends: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: In: ADP, the: DET, coding: VERB, analogy: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, it: PRON, 's: AUX, like: ADP, programmers: NOUN, deciding: VERB, which: DET, lines: NOUN, of: ADP, code: NOUN, are: AUX, the: DET, coolest: ADJ, and: CCONJ, should: AUX, be: AUX, inherited: VERB, by: ADP, future: ADJ, generations: NOUN, of: ADP, software: NOUN, .: PUNCT
