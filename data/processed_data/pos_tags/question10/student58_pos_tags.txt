S1: The: DET, question: NOUN, of: ADP, whether: SCONJ, electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, are: AUX, truly: ADV, ": PUNCT, green: ADJ, ": PUNCT, is: AUX, a: DET, complex: ADJ, one: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, as: SCONJ, it: PRON, involves: VERB, considering: VERB, the: DET, emissions: NOUN, generated: VERB, not: PART, only: ADV, by: ADP, the: DET, vehicles: NOUN, themselves: PRON, but: CCONJ, also: ADV, by: ADP, the: DET, production: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, electricity: NOUN, used: VERB, to: PART, power: VERB, them: PRON, .: PUNCT
S2: While: SCONJ, it: PRON, is: AUX, true: ADJ, that: SCONJ, producing: VERB, electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, leads: VERB, to: ADP, significantly: ADV, more: ADJ, emissions: NOUN, than: ADP, producing: VERB, petrol: NOUN, cars: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, experts: NOUN, broadly: ADV, agree: VERB, that: SCONJ, electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, create: VERB, a: DET, lower: ADJ, carbon: NOUN, footprint: NOUN, over: ADP, the: DET, course: NOUN, of: ADP, internal: ADJ, combustion: NOUN, engines: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: The: DET, batteries: NOUN, in: ADP, electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, charge: VERB, on: ADP, power: NOUN, that: PRON, is: AUX, coming: VERB, straight: ADV, off: ADP, the: DET, electric: ADJ, grid: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, which: PRON, is: AUX, itself: PRON, often: ADV, powered: VERB, by: ADP, fossil: ADJ, fuels: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: However: ADV, ,: PUNCT, as: SCONJ, the: DET, world: NOUN, shifts: NOUN, towards: ADP, renewable: ADJ, energy: NOUN, sources: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, carbon: NOUN, footprint: NOUN, of: ADP, electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, is: AUX, expected: VERB, to: PART, decrease: VERB, further: ADV, .: PUNCT
S5: Moreover: ADV, ,: PUNCT, electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, are: AUX, more: ADV, efficient: ADJ, than: ADP, traditional: ADJ, internal: ADJ, combustion: NOUN, engines: NOUN, that: PRON, burn: VERB, fossil: ADJ, fuels: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, they: PRON, produce: VERB, zero: NUM, tailpipe: NOUN, emissions: NOUN, when: SCONJ, running: VERB, only: ADV, on: ADP, electricity: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: While: SCONJ, the: DET, production: NOUN, of: ADP, electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, and: CCONJ, their: PRON, batteries: NOUN, is: AUX, more: ADJ, emissions: NOUN, -: PUNCT, intensive: ADJ, than: ADP, that: PRON, of: ADP, traditional: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, overall: ADJ, lifetime: NOUN, emissions: NOUN, of: ADP, electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, are: AUX, lower: ADJ, than: ADP, those: PRON, of: ADP, gasoline: NOUN, cars: NOUN, .: PUNCT
