S1: Electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, are: AUX, said: VERB, to: PART, be: AUX, greener: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, electricity: NOUN, production: NOUN, itself: PRON, causes: VERB, a: DET, lot: NOUN, of: ADP, pollution: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: What: PRON, do: AUX, you: PRON, think: VERB, about: ADP, this: PRON, ?: PUNCT
S3: Ans-: CCONJ, 
: SPACE, Electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, (: PUNCT, EVs: PROPN, ): PUNCT, are: AUX, often: ADV, considered: VERB, greener: ADJ, than: ADP, traditional: ADJ, internal: ADJ, combustion: NOUN, engine: NOUN, vehicles: NOUN, due: ADP, to: ADP, their: PRON, lower: ADJ, direct: ADJ, emissions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: However: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, environmental: ADJ, impact: NOUN, of: ADP, EVs: PROPN, is: AUX, closely: ADV, tied: VERB, to: ADP, the: DET, source: NOUN, of: ADP, electricity: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: If: SCONJ, the: DET, electricity: NOUN, comes: VERB, from: ADP, renewable: ADJ, sources: NOUN, like: ADP, wind: NOUN, or: CCONJ, solar: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, overall: ADJ, environmental: ADJ, footprint: NOUN, is: AUX, significantly: ADV, reduced: VERB, .: PUNCT
S6: While: SCONJ, it: PRON, 's: AUX, true: ADJ, that: SCONJ, some: DET, regions: NOUN, still: ADV, rely: VERB, on: ADP, fossil: ADJ, fuels: NOUN, for: ADP, electricity: NOUN, generation: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, shift: NOUN, towards: ADP, cleaner: ADJ, energy: NOUN, sources: NOUN, is: AUX, ongoing: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S7: Governments: NOUN, and: CCONJ, industries: NOUN, worldwide: ADV, are: AUX, investing: VERB, in: ADP, renewable: ADJ, energy: NOUN, infrastructure: NOUN, to: PART, make: VERB, the: DET, electricity: NOUN, grid: NOUN, more: ADV, sustainable: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S8: Additionally: ADV, ,: PUNCT, advancements: NOUN, in: ADP, battery: NOUN, technology: NOUN, are: AUX, improving: VERB, the: DET, efficiency: NOUN, of: ADP, energy: NOUN, storage: NOUN, in: ADP, EVs: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S9: Recycling: VERB, initiatives: NOUN, for: ADP, used: VERB, batteries: NOUN, further: ADV, contribute: VERB, to: ADP, minimizing: VERB, environmental: ADJ, impact: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: In: ADP, essence: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, green: ADJ, credentials: NOUN, of: ADP, electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, depend: VERB, on: ADP, the: DET, broader: ADJ, energy: NOUN, landscape: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: As: SCONJ, we: PRON, transition: VERB, to: ADP, cleaner: ADJ, energy: NOUN, sources: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, benefits: NOUN, of: ADP, EVs: PROPN, in: ADP, reducing: VERB, air: NOUN, pollution: NOUN, and: CCONJ, greenhouse: NOUN, gas: NOUN, emissions: NOUN, will: AUX, continue: VERB, to: PART, grow: VERB, ,: PUNCT, making: VERB, them: PRON, a: DET, crucial: ADJ, element: NOUN, in: ADP, sustainable: ADJ, transportation: NOUN, solutions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
