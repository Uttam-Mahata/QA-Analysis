S4: While: SCONJ, they: PRON, ditch: VERB, tailpipe: ADJ, fumes: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, electricity: NOUN, generation: NOUN, is: AUX, n't: PART, spotless: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S5: But: CCONJ, here: ADV, 's: AUX, the: DET, twist: NOUN, :: PUNCT, 

: SPACE, Greener: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, yes: INTJ, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, not: PART, perfect: ADJ, :: PUNCT, EVs: NOUN, emit: VERB, zero: NUM, air: NOUN, pollution: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, a: DET, huge: ADJ, win: NOUN, for: ADP, local: ADJ, health: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: And: CCONJ, even: ADV, accounting: VERB, for: ADP, electricity: NOUN, 's: PART, dirty: ADJ, side: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, their: PRON, lifetime: NOUN, carbon: NOUN, footprint: NOUN, is: AUX, generally: ADV, lower: ADJ, than: ADP, gas: NOUN, guzzlers: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, especially: ADV, in: ADP, regions: NOUN, with: ADP, cleaner: ADJ, grids: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: The: DET, not: PART, -: PUNCT, so: ADV, -: PUNCT, green: ADJ, bits: NOUN, :: PUNCT, Fossil: ADJ, fuel: NOUN, -: PUNCT, powered: VERB, plants: NOUN, still: ADV, churn: VERB, out: ADP, emissions: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, battery: NOUN, production: NOUN, has: VERB, its: PRON, own: ADJ, environmental: ADJ, baggage: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: Plus: CCONJ, ,: PUNCT, scaling: VERB, up: ADP, the: DET, electricity: NOUN, grid: NOUN, can: AUX, have: VERB, its: PRON, own: ADJ, ecological: ADJ, costs: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: The: DET, good: ADJ, news: NOUN, :: PUNCT, The: DET, story: NOUN, 's: AUX, not: PART, over: ADV, .: PUNCT
