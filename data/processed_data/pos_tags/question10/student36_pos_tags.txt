S1: Electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, are: AUX, said: VERB, to: PART, be: AUX, greener: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, electricity: NOUN, production: NOUN, itself: PRON, causes: VERB, a: DET, lot: NOUN, of: ADP, pollution: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: What: PRON, do: AUX, you: PRON, think: VERB, about: ADP, this: PRON, ?: PUNCT
S3: Ans-: X, 
: SPACE, Calling: VERB, EVs: NOUN, ": PUNCT, unconditionally: ADV, green: ADJ, ": PUNCT, is: AUX, misleading: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S4: Yes: INTJ, ,: PUNCT, they: PRON, ditch: VERB, tailpipe: ADJ, fumes: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, the: DET, electricity: NOUN, powering: VERB, them: PRON, often: ADV, comes: VERB, with: ADP, its: PRON, own: ADJ, dirty: ADJ, baggage: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: It: PRON, 's: AUX, a: DET, nuanced: VERB, picture: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: On: ADP, the: DET, plus: ADJ, side: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, EVs: PROPN, boast: VERB, zero: NUM, tailpipe: NOUN, emissions: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, improving: VERB, local: ADJ, air: NOUN, quality: NOUN, and: CCONJ, public: ADJ, health: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Their: PRON, lower: ADJ, lifetime: NOUN, emissions: NOUN, compared: VERB, to: ADP, gas: NOUN, cars: NOUN, hold: VERB, water: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, especially: ADV, in: ADP, regions: NOUN, relying: VERB, on: ADP, cleaner: ADJ, energy: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: Plus: CCONJ, ,: PUNCT, they: PRON, 're: AUX, energy: NOUN, -: PUNCT, efficient: ADJ, and: CCONJ, their: PRON, footprint: NOUN, shrinks: NOUN, as: SCONJ, grids: NOUN, get: VERB, greener: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S9: But: CCONJ, do: AUX, n't: PART, forget: VERB, the: DET, grime: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: Fossil: ADJ, fuel: NOUN, power: NOUN, plants: NOUN, create: VERB, harmful: ADJ, emissions: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, battery: NOUN, production: NOUN, can: AUX, be: AUX, messy: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S11: Upgrading: VERB, the: DET, grid: NOUN, also: ADV, has: VERB, environmental: ADJ, costs: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: So: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, verdict: NOUN, ?: PUNCT
S13: EVs: NOUN, are: AUX, greener: ADJ, on: ADP, balance: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, we: PRON, need: VERB, to: PART, address: VERB, the: DET, dirty: ADJ, bits: NOUN, :: PUNCT, 

: SPACE, Invest: VERB, in: ADP, renewables: NOUN, :: PUNCT, Wind: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, solar: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, hydropower: NOUN, make: VERB, EV: PROPN, use: VERB, truly: ADV, clean: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S14: Clean: VERB, up: ADP, battery: NOUN, production: NOUN, :: PUNCT, Recycle: PROPN, materials: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, reduce: VERB, emissions: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, extend: VERB, battery: NOUN, life: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S15: Boost: VERB, energy: NOUN, efficiency: NOUN, :: PUNCT, Smart: PROPN, grids: NOUN, and: CCONJ, eco: NOUN, -: PUNCT, driving: VERB, habits: NOUN, matter: ADV, .: PUNCT
S16: Ultimately: ADV, ,: PUNCT, EVs: NOUN, are: AUX, a: DET, step: NOUN, towards: ADP, a: DET, cleaner: ADJ, future: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, not: PART, a: DET, magic: ADJ, bullet: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S17: By: ADP, actively: ADV, cleaning: VERB, up: ADP, their: PRON, supporting: VERB, systems: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, we: PRON, can: AUX, accelerate: VERB, the: DET, journey: NOUN, towards: ADP, a: DET, truly: ADV, sustainable: ADJ, transportation: NOUN, landscape: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S18: Remember: VERB, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, story: NOUN, of: ADP, EV: PROPN, pollution: NOUN, is: AUX, constantly: ADV, evolving: VERB, .: PUNCT
S19: Stay: VERB, informed: ADJ, and: CCONJ, keep: VERB, pushing: VERB, for: ADP, a: DET, greener: ADJ, future: NOUN, !: PUNCT
