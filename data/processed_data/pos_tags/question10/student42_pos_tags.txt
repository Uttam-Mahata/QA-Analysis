S2: What: PRON, do: AUX, you: PRON, think: VERB, about: ADP, this: PRON, ?: PUNCT
S3: Ans-: CCONJ, 
: SPACE, Electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, (: PUNCT, EVs: PROPN, ): PUNCT, are: AUX, often: ADV, heralded: VERB, for: ADP, their: PRON, environmental: ADJ, benefits: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, primarily: ADV, stemming: VERB, from: ADP, their: PRON, lower: ADJ, direct: ADJ, emissions: NOUN, compared: VERB, to: ADP, traditional: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: However: ADV, ,: PUNCT, critics: NOUN, argue: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, overall: ADJ, ecological: ADJ, impact: NOUN, of: ADP, EVs: PROPN, is: AUX, contingent: ADJ, on: ADP, the: DET, energy: NOUN, sources: NOUN, powering: VERB, their: PRON, electricity: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Regions: NOUN, heavily: ADV, reliant: ADJ, on: ADP, fossil: ADJ, fuels: NOUN, for: ADP, energy: NOUN, generation: NOUN, may: AUX, undermine: VERB, the: DET, perceived: VERB, green: ADJ, advantages: NOUN, of: ADP, EVs: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: The: DET, ongoing: ADJ, global: ADJ, transition: NOUN, towards: ADP, renewable: ADJ, energy: NOUN, sources: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, such: ADJ, as: ADP, wind: NOUN, and: CCONJ, solar: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, plays: VERB, a: DET, pivotal: ADJ, role: NOUN, in: ADP, mitigating: VERB, this: DET, concern: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Governments: NOUN, and: CCONJ, industries: NOUN, are: AUX, actively: ADV, investing: VERB, in: ADP, sustainable: ADJ, energy: NOUN, infrastructure: NOUN, to: PART, decarbonize: VERB, the: DET, electricity: NOUN, grid: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: As: ADP, a: DET, result: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, carbon: NOUN, footprint: NOUN, associated: VERB, with: ADP, charging: VERB, EVs: PROPN, is: AUX, progressively: ADV, diminishing: VERB, .: PUNCT
