S1: The: DET, statement: NOUN, that: SCONJ, electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, (: PUNCT, EVs: PROPN, ): PUNCT, are: AUX, greener: ADJ, is: AUX, both: CCONJ, true: ADJ, and: CCONJ, nuanced: VERB, .: PUNCT
S2: While: SCONJ, it: PRON, 's: AUX, undeniable: ADJ, that: SCONJ, EVs: PROPN, produce: VERB, zero: NUM, tailpipe: NOUN, emissions: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, electricity: NOUN, to: PART, power: NOUN, them: PRON, does: AUX, come: VERB, from: ADP, various: ADJ, sources: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, some: DET, cleaner: ADJ, than: ADP, others: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: EVs: NOUN, are: AUX, undoubtedly: ADV, cleaner: ADJ, at: ADP, the: DET, point: NOUN, of: ADP, use: NOUN, compared: VERB, to: ADP, traditional: ADJ, gasoline: NOUN, -: PUNCT, powered: VERB, vehicles: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: They: PRON, emit: VERB, no: DET, tailpipe: NOUN, pollutants: NOUN, like: ADP, nitrogen: NOUN, oxides: NOUN, (: PUNCT, NOx: NOUN, ): PUNCT, ,: PUNCT, particulate: NOUN, matter: NOUN, (: PUNCT, PM: PROPN, ): PUNCT, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, greenhouse: NOUN, gases: NOUN, like: ADP, carbon: NOUN, dioxide: NOUN, (: PUNCT, CO2: PROPN, ): PUNCT, ,: PUNCT, which: PRON, significantly: ADV, contribute: VERB, to: ADP, air: NOUN, pollution: NOUN, and: CCONJ, climate: NOUN, change: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: The: DET, environmental: ADJ, impact: NOUN, of: ADP, EVs: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, however: ADV, ,: PUNCT, depends: VERB, heavily: ADV, on: ADP, how: SCONJ, the: DET, electricity: NOUN, they: PRON, use: VERB, is: AUX, generated: VERB, .: PUNCT
S6: Coal: NOUN, -: PUNCT, fired: VERB, power: NOUN, plants: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, for: ADP, instance: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, are: AUX, major: ADJ, polluters: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, releasing: VERB, significant: ADJ, CO2: PROPN, and: CCONJ, other: ADJ, harmful: ADJ, emissions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Conversely: ADV, ,: PUNCT, renewable: ADJ, energy: NOUN, sources: NOUN, like: ADP, solar: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, wind: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, hydro: NOUN, power: NOUN, generate: VERB, electricity: NOUN, with: ADP, minimal: ADJ, environmental: ADJ, impact: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: So: ADV, ,: PUNCT, EVs: NOUN, powered: VERB, by: ADP, clean: ADJ, energy: NOUN, grids: NOUN, have: VERB, a: DET, significantly: ADV, lower: ADJ, carbon: NOUN, footprint: NOUN, than: ADP, gasoline: NOUN, vehicles: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: Battery: NOUN, production: NOUN, can: AUX, be: AUX, resource: NOUN, -: PUNCT, intensive: ADJ, and: CCONJ, generate: VERB, pollution: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, though: SCONJ, technologies: NOUN, are: AUX, rapidly: ADV, improving: VERB, .: PUNCT
