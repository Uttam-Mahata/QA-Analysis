S1: Electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, are: AUX, said: VERB, to: PART, be: AUX, greener: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, electricity: NOUN, production: NOUN, itself: PRON, causes: VERB, a: DET, lot: NOUN, of: ADP, pollution: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: What: PRON, do: AUX, you: PRON, think: VERB, about: ADP, this: PRON, ?: PUNCT
S3: Ans-: X, 
: SPACE, Replacing: VERB, gas: NOUN, guzzlers: NOUN, with: ADP, electric: ADJ, chariots: NOUN, is: AUX, a: DET, step: NOUN, towards: ADP, a: DET, greener: ADJ, future: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, it: PRON, 's: AUX, not: PART, a: DET, clean: ADJ, getaway: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: While: SCONJ, EVs: PROPN, boast: VERB, zero: NUM, tailpipes: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, electricity: NOUN, production: NOUN, often: ADV, spits: VERB, out: ADP, its: PRON, own: ADJ, smog: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: So: ADV, ,: PUNCT, greener: ADJ, ?: PUNCT
S6: Yes: INTJ, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, with: ADP, caveats: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Firstly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, EVs: PROPN, breathe: VERB, cleaner: ADJ, air: NOUN, into: ADP, our: PRON, lungs: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: No: PRON, more: ADV, choking: ADJ, on: ADP, tailpipe: ADJ, toxins: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, meaning: VERB, healthier: ADJ, cities: NOUN, and: CCONJ, happier: ADJ, lungs: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: Secondly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, their: PRON, carbon: NOUN, footprint: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, even: ADV, accounting: VERB, for: ADP, electricity: NOUN, 's: PART, dark: ADJ, side: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, is: AUX, generally: ADV, lighter: ADJ, than: ADP, gasoline: NOUN, guzzlers: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: It: PRON, 's: AUX, like: ADP, choosing: VERB, the: DET, lesser: ADJ, evil: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, especially: ADV, in: ADP, regions: NOUN, powered: VERB, by: ADP, renewable: ADJ, sunshine: NOUN, or: CCONJ, wind: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: But: CCONJ, the: DET, electricity: NOUN, fairy: NOUN, is: AUX, n't: PART, always: ADV, eco: NOUN, -: ADV, friendly: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S12: Coal: NOUN, -: PUNCT, powered: VERB, plants: NOUN, still: ADV, cough: VERB, up: ADP, fumes: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, battery: NOUN, production: NOUN, can: AUX, leave: VERB, a: DET, scar: NOUN, on: ADP, the: DET, Earth: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S13: However: ADV, ,: PUNCT, this: PRON, does: AUX, n't: PART, mean: VERB, EVs: NOUN, are: AUX, a: DET, dead: ADJ, end: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S14: The: DET, green: ADJ, revolution: NOUN, is: AUX, charging: VERB, forward: ADV, ,: PUNCT, with: ADP, renewable: ADJ, energy: NOUN, sources: NOUN, growing: VERB, like: ADP, wildfire: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S15: Cleaner: PROPN, grids: NOUN, mean: VERB, cleaner: ADJ, EVs: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, making: VERB, them: PRON, increasingly: ADV, guilt: NOUN, -: PUNCT, free: ADJ, rides: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S16: Ultimately: ADV, ,: PUNCT, EVs: NOUN, are: AUX, a: DET, step: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, right: ADJ, direction: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, not: PART, a: DET, magic: ADJ, solution: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S17: We: PRON, need: VERB, to: PART, keep: VERB, pushing: VERB, for: ADP, cleaner: ADJ, energy: NOUN, sources: NOUN, and: CCONJ, sustainable: ADJ, battery: NOUN, production: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S18: But: CCONJ, one: NUM, thing: NOUN, 's: AUX, for: ADP, sure: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, swapping: VERB, gas: NOUN, for: ADP, electrons: NOUN, is: AUX, a: DET, move: NOUN, towards: ADP, a: DET, healthier: ADJ, planet: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, one: NUM, silent: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, smog: NOUN, -: PUNCT, free: ADJ, mile: NOUN, at: ADP, a: DET, time: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S19: Remember: VERB, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, greenest: ADJ, vehicle: NOUN, is: AUX, the: DET, one: NUM, that: PRON, stays: AUX, parked: VERB, .: PUNCT
S20: But: CCONJ, when: SCONJ, you: PRON, need: VERB, to: PART, roll: VERB, ,: PUNCT, an: DET, EV: PROPN, is: AUX, a: DET, better: ADJ, bet: NOUN, than: ADP, its: PRON, fossil: NOUN, -: PUNCT, fueled: VERB, cousin: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S21: Let: VERB, 's: PRON, keep: VERB, the: DET, green: ADJ, wheels: NOUN, spinning: NOUN, and: CCONJ, the: DET, smog: NOUN, clouds: NOUN, fading: VERB, .: PUNCT
