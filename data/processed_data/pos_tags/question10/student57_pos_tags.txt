S1: The: DET, environmental: ADJ, impact: NOUN, of: ADP, electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, (: PUNCT, EVs: PROPN, ): PUNCT, is: AUX, indeed: ADV, a: DET, complex: ADJ, and: CCONJ, multifaceted: ADJ, issue: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: While: SCONJ, EVs: NOUN, are: AUX, often: ADV, considered: VERB, greener: ADJ, in: ADP, terms: NOUN, of: ADP, tailpipe: ADJ, emissions: NOUN, compared: VERB, to: ADP, traditional: ADJ, internal: ADJ, combustion: NOUN, engine: NOUN, vehicles: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, it: PRON, is: AUX, important: ADJ, to: PART, examine: VERB, the: DET, entire: ADJ, lifecycle: NOUN, of: ADP, these: DET, vehicles: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, including: VERB, electricity: NOUN, production: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: The: DET, overall: ADJ, environmental: ADJ, impact: NOUN, of: ADP, EVs: PROPN, is: AUX, expected: VERB, to: PART, improve: VERB, as: ADP, the: DET, energy: NOUN, sector: NOUN, transitions: NOUN, to: ADP, cleaner: ADJ, and: CCONJ, more: ADV, sustainable: ADJ, sources: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Many: ADJ, countries: NOUN, are: AUX, investing: VERB, in: ADP, renewable: ADJ, energy: NOUN, infrastructure: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, the: DET, increasing: VERB, share: NOUN, of: ADP, renewables: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, energy: NOUN, mix: NOUN, enhances: VERB, the: DET, environmental: ADJ, credentials: NOUN, of: ADP, EVs: PROPN, over: ADP, time: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Electric: ADJ, motors: NOUN, are: AUX, generally: ADV, more: ADV, efficient: ADJ, than: ADP, internal: ADJ, combustion: NOUN, engines: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, which: PRON, means: VERB, that: SCONJ, even: ADV, when: SCONJ, accounting: VERB, for: ADP, power: NOUN, plant: NOUN, emissions: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, overall: ADJ, energy: NOUN, efficiency: NOUN, of: ADP, EVs: PROPN, can: AUX, be: AUX, higher: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S6: This: DET, efficiency: NOUN, advantage: NOUN, can: AUX, help: VERB, reduce: VERB, the: DET, total: ADJ, environmental: ADJ, impact: NOUN, compared: VERB, to: ADP, traditional: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: However: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, environmental: ADJ, impact: NOUN, of: ADP, EVs: PROPN, depends: VERB, on: ADP, the: DET, energy: NOUN, sources: NOUN, used: VERB, for: ADP, electricity: NOUN, production: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: If: SCONJ, the: DET, electricity: NOUN, is: AUX, generated: VERB, from: ADP, renewable: ADJ, sources: NOUN, such: ADJ, as: ADP, wind: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, solar: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, hydro: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, or: CCONJ, nuclear: ADJ, power: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, overall: ADJ, carbon: NOUN, footprint: NOUN, of: ADP, EVs: PROPN, can: AUX, be: AUX, significantly: ADV, lower: ADJ, compared: VERB, to: ADP, traditional: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, .: PUNCT
