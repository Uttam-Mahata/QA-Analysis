S1: The: DET, environmental: ADJ, impact: NOUN, of: ADP, electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, (: PUNCT, EVs: PROPN, ): PUNCT, is: AUX, a: DET, complex: ADJ, issue: NOUN, that: PRON, involves: VERB, assessing: VERB, not: PART, only: ADV, the: DET, direct: ADJ, emissions: NOUN, from: ADP, the: DET, vehicles: NOUN, but: CCONJ, also: ADV, the: DET, broader: ADJ, context: NOUN, of: ADP, electricity: NOUN, production: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Electric: ADJ, motors: NOUN, are: AUX, generally: ADV, more: ADJ, energy: NOUN, -: PUNCT, efficient: ADJ, than: ADP, internal: ADJ, combustion: NOUN, engines: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: EVs: PROPN, convert: VERB, a: DET, higher: ADJ, percentage: NOUN, of: ADP, electrical: ADJ, energy: NOUN, from: ADP, the: DET, grid: NOUN, to: ADP, power: NOUN, at: ADP, the: DET, wheels: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, resulting: VERB, in: ADP, overall: ADJ, energy: NOUN, efficiency: NOUN, gains: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Assessing: VERB, the: DET, environmental: ADJ, impact: NOUN, of: ADP, EVs: PROPN, requires: VERB, considering: VERB, their: PRON, entire: ADJ, life: NOUN, cycle: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, including: VERB, manufacturing: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, use: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, disposal: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: The: DET, production: NOUN, of: ADP, batteries: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, in: ADP, particular: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, involves: VERB, resource: NOUN, extraction: NOUN, and: CCONJ, energy: NOUN, -: PUNCT, intensive: ADJ, processes: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, impacting: VERB, the: DET, overall: ADJ, carbon: NOUN, footprint: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Developing: VERB, effective: ADJ, recycling: NOUN, methods: NOUN, for: ADP, batteries: NOUN, is: AUX, essential: ADJ, to: PART, minimize: VERB, the: DET, environmental: ADJ, impact: NOUN, of: ADP, raw: ADJ, material: NOUN, extraction: NOUN, and: CCONJ, waste: NOUN, disposal: NOUN, .: PUNCT, Enhancing: VERB, the: DET, efficiency: NOUN, of: ADP, electricity: NOUN, generation: NOUN, and: CCONJ, distribution: NOUN, can: AUX, contribute: VERB, to: ADP, reducing: VERB, the: DET, overall: ADJ, environmental: ADJ, impact: NOUN, of: ADP, electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, .: PUNCT
