S1: The: DET, environmental: ADJ, impact: NOUN, of: ADP, electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, (: PUNCT, EVs: PROPN, ): PUNCT, depends: VERB, on: ADP, various: ADJ, factors: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, including: VERB, the: DET, source: NOUN, of: ADP, electricity: NOUN, used: VERB, for: ADP, their: PRON, operation: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: While: SCONJ, EVs: NOUN, are: AUX, considered: VERB, greener: ADJ, and: CCONJ, more: ADV, sustainable: ADJ, than: ADP, traditional: ADJ, internal: ADJ, combustion: NOUN, engine: NOUN, vehicles: NOUN, in: ADP, many: ADJ, aspects: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, it: PRON, is: AUX, true: ADJ, that: SCONJ, electricity: NOUN, production: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, particularly: ADV, from: ADP, non: ADJ, -: ADJ, renewable: ADJ, sources: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, can: AUX, contribute: VERB, to: ADP, pollution: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Many: ADJ, countries: NOUN, are: AUX, working: VERB, towards: ADP, decarbonizing: VERB, their: PRON, electricity: NOUN, grids: NOUN, by: ADP, increasing: VERB, the: DET, share: NOUN, of: ADP, renewable: ADJ, energy: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: As: SCONJ, the: DET, grid: NOUN, becomes: VERB, greener: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, environmental: ADJ, advantages: NOUN, of: ADP, electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, become: VERB, more: ADV, pronounced: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S5: The: DET, ongoing: ADJ, transition: NOUN, to: ADP, cleaner: ADJ, energy: NOUN, sources: NOUN, enhances: VERB, the: DET, overall: ADJ, sustainability: NOUN, of: ADP, EVs: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S6: Electric: ADJ, vehicles: NOUN, are: AUX, generally: ADV, more: ADJ, energy: NOUN, -: PUNCT, efficient: ADJ, than: ADP, traditional: ADJ, internal: ADJ, combustion: NOUN, engine: NOUN, vehicles: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: EVs: PROPN, convert: VERB, a: DET, higher: ADJ, percentage: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, electrical: ADJ, energy: NOUN, from: ADP, the: DET, grid: NOUN, to: ADP, power: NOUN, at: ADP, the: DET, wheels: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, compared: VERB, to: ADP, the: DET, energy: NOUN, conversion: NOUN, efficiency: NOUN, of: ADP, internal: ADJ, combustion: NOUN, engines: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: This: DET, efficiency: NOUN, contributes: VERB, to: PART, lower: VERB, overall: ADJ, energy: NOUN, consumption: NOUN, and: CCONJ, reduced: VERB, environmental: ADJ, impact: NOUN, .: PUNCT
