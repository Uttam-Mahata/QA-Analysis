S10: In: ADP, groups: NOUN, and: CCONJ, organizations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, stratification: NOUN, may: AUX, take: VERB, the: DET, form: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, distribution: NOUN, of: ADP, power: NOUN, and: CCONJ, authority: NOUN, down: ADP, the: DET, ranks: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: Think: VERB, of: ADP, the: DET, different: ADJ, ways: NOUN, that: PRON, status: NOUN, is: AUX, determined: VERB, in: ADP, the: DET, military: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, schools: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, clubs: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, businesses: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, even: ADV, groupings: NOUN, of: ADP, friends: NOUN, and: CCONJ, peers: NOUN, .: PUNCT
