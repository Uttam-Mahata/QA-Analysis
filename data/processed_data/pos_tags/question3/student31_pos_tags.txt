S10: Social: ADJ, cohesion: NOUN, and: CCONJ, conflict: NOUN, :: PUNCT, Unequal: ADJ, distribution: NOUN, of: ADP, resources: NOUN, and: CCONJ, opportunities: NOUN, can: AUX, breed: VERB, resentment: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, division: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, even: ADV, conflict: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, while: SCONJ, a: DET, more: ADV, equitable: ADJ, society: NOUN, fosters: NOUN, greater: ADJ, cohesion: NOUN, and: CCONJ, stability: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: Social: ADJ, stratification: NOUN, is: AUX, n't: PART, just: ADV, about: ADP, money: NOUN, ;: PUNCT, it: PRON, 's: AUX, about: ADV, a: DET, web: NOUN, of: ADP, interconnected: VERB, factors: NOUN, :: PUNCT, 

: SPACE, Race: NOUN, and: CCONJ, ethnicity: NOUN, :: PUNCT, Historical: ADJ, prejudices: NOUN, and: CCONJ, discriminatory: ADJ, practices: NOUN, can: AUX, disadvantage: VERB, entire: ADJ, groups: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, locking: VERB, them: PRON, into: ADP, lower: ADJ, rungs: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: Gender: NOUN, :: PUNCT, Gender: NOUN, roles: NOUN, and: CCONJ, inequalities: NOUN, can: AUX, limit: VERB, opportunities: NOUN, and: CCONJ, access: NOUN, to: ADP, resources: NOUN, for: ADP, certain: ADJ, genders: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S13: Education: NOUN, and: CCONJ, skills: NOUN, :: PUNCT, Knowledge: PROPN, and: CCONJ, skills: NOUN, can: AUX, act: VERB, as: ADP, keys: NOUN, to: PART, unlock: VERB, higher: ADJ, rungs: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, while: SCONJ, lack: NOUN, of: ADP, access: NOUN, to: ADP, education: NOUN, can: AUX, trap: VERB, individuals: NOUN, at: ADP, the: DET, bottom: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S14: Understanding: VERB, social: ADJ, stratification: NOUN, is: AUX, crucial: ADJ, for: ADP, :: PUNCT, 

: SPACE, Promoting: VERB, social: ADJ, justice: NOUN, :: PUNCT, Identifying: VERB, and: CCONJ, addressing: VERB, systemic: ADJ, inequalities: NOUN, to: PART, create: VERB, a: DET, fairer: ADJ, society: NOUN, with: ADP, equal: ADJ, opportunities: NOUN, for: ADP, all: PRON, .: PUNCT
S15: Formulating: VERB, effective: ADJ, policies: NOUN, :: PUNCT, Designing: NOUN, policies: NOUN, that: PRON, address: VERB, the: DET, needs: NOUN, of: ADP, different: ADJ, social: ADJ, groups: NOUN, and: CCONJ, promote: VERB, upward: ADJ, mobility: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S16: Building: VERB, a: DET, more: ADV, cohesive: ADJ, society: NOUN, :: PUNCT, Fostering: VERB, empathy: NOUN, and: CCONJ, understanding: NOUN, across: ADP, different: ADJ, social: ADJ, strata: NOUN, to: PART, bridge: VERB, divides: NOUN, and: CCONJ, build: VERB, a: DET, more: ADV, equitable: ADJ, future: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S17: So: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, next: ADJ, time: NOUN, you: PRON, interact: VERB, with: ADP, someone: PRON, from: ADP, a: DET, different: ADJ, social: ADJ, background: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, remember: VERB, the: DET, invisible: ADJ, staircase: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S18: Think: VERB, beyond: ADP, individual: ADJ, circumstances: NOUN, and: CCONJ, recognize: VERB, the: DET, broader: ADJ, systems: NOUN, and: CCONJ, structures: NOUN, that: PRON, shape: VERB, their: PRON, experiences: NOUN, and: CCONJ, your: PRON, own: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S19: By: ADP, understanding: VERB, social: ADJ, stratification: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, we: PRON, can: AUX, work: VERB, towards: ADP, a: DET, world: NOUN, where: SCONJ, everyone: PRON, has: VERB, a: DET, chance: NOUN, to: PART, climb: VERB, the: DET, ladder: NOUN, and: CCONJ, reach: VERB, their: PRON, full: ADJ, potential: NOUN, .: PUNCT
