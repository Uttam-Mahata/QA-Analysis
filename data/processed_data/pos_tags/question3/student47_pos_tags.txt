S13: In: ADP, some: DET, cultures: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, elderly: ADJ, are: AUX, esteemed: VERB, ,: PUNCT, while: SCONJ, in: ADP, others: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, elderly: ADJ, are: AUX, disparaged: VERB, or: CCONJ, overlooked: VERB, .: PUNCT
S14: Societies: NOUN, ’: PART, cultural: ADJ, beliefs: NOUN, often: ADV, reinforce: VERB, stratification: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S15: One: NUM, key: ADJ, determinant: NOUN, of: ADP, social: ADJ, standing: NOUN, is: AUX, our: PRON, parents: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S16: Parents: NOUN, tend: VERB, to: PART, pass: VERB, their: PRON, social: ADJ, position: NOUN, on: ADP, to: ADP, their: PRON, children: NOUN, .: PUNCT

S19: This: PRON, is: AUX, one: NUM, of: ADP, the: DET, reasons: NOUN, first: ADJ, -: PUNCT, generation: NOUN, college: NOUN, students: NOUN, do: AUX, not: PART, fare: VERB, as: ADV, well: ADV, as: ADP, other: ADJ, students: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S20: They: PRON, lack: VERB, access: NOUN, to: ADP, the: DET, resources: NOUN, and: CCONJ, support: NOUN, commonly: ADV, provided: VERB, to: ADP, those: PRON, whose: DET, parents: NOUN, have: AUX, gone: VERB, to: ADP, college: NOUN, .: PUNCT
