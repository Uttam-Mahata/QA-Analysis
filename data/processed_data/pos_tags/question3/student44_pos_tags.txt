S1: Explain: VERB, the: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, social: ADJ, stratification: NOUN, and: CCONJ, its: PRON, impact: NOUN, on: ADP, societies: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Ans-: CCONJ, 
: SPACE, Imagine: VERB, a: DET, cake: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Not: PART, just: ADV, any: DET, cake: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, a: DET, giant: ADJ, layer: NOUN, cake: NOUN, where: SCONJ, each: DET, layer: NOUN, represents: VERB, a: DET, different: ADJ, group: NOUN, of: ADP, people: NOUN, in: ADP, society: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: The: DET, top: ADJ, layer: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, with: ADP, the: DET, fanciest: ADJ, frosting: NOUN, and: CCONJ, biggest: ADJ, slices: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, has: VERB, all: DET, the: DET, rich: ADJ, folks: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: The: DET, middle: ADJ, layer: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, with: ADP, smaller: ADJ, slices: NOUN, and: CCONJ, less: ADJ, decoration: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, holds: VERB, the: DET, regular: ADJ, Joes: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: And: CCONJ, the: DET, bottom: ADJ, layer: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, well: INTJ, ,: PUNCT, let: VERB, 's: PRON, just: ADV, say: VERB, it: PRON, 's: AUX, a: DET, bit: NOUN, crumbly: ADV, and: CCONJ, forgotten: VERB, .: PUNCT
S7: That: PRON, ,: PUNCT, roughly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, is: AUX, the: DET, idea: NOUN, of: ADP, social: ADJ, stratification: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: It: PRON, 's: AUX, the: DET, way: NOUN, societies: NOUN, stack: VERB, people: NOUN, up: ADP, based: VERB, on: ADP, things: NOUN, like: ADP, money: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, education: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, family: NOUN, background: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, even: ADV, race: NOUN, or: CCONJ, gender: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: Each: DET, layer: NOUN, gets: VERB, different: ADJ, amounts: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, good: ADJ, stuff: NOUN, in: ADP, life: NOUN, –: PUNCT, opportunities: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, privileges: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, respect: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: So: ADV, ,: PUNCT, how: SCONJ, does: AUX, this: DET, cakey: NOUN, system: NOUN, impact: VERB, the: DET, whole: ADJ, party: NOUN, ?: PUNCT
S11: Unequal: ADJ, slices: NOUN, :: PUNCT, The: DET, top: ADJ, layer: NOUN, gets: VERB, the: DET, biggest: ADJ, bites: NOUN, of: ADP, education: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, healthcare: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, opportunities: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: They: PRON, climb: VERB, the: DET, career: NOUN, ladder: NOUN, faster: ADV, ,: PUNCT, live: VERB, in: ADP, better: ADJ, neighborhoods: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, maybe: ADV, even: ADV, have: VERB, a: DET, personal: ADJ, chef: NOUN, to: PART, bake: VERB, their: PRON, own: ADJ, fancy: ADJ, cakes: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S13: Limited: ADJ, options: NOUN, :: PUNCT, The: DET, middle: ADJ, layer: NOUN, is: AUX, n't: PART, starving: VERB, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, their: PRON, slices: NOUN, are: AUX, smaller: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S14: They: PRON, work: VERB, hard: ADV, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, might: AUX, struggle: VERB, to: PART, pay: VERB, bills: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, access: NOUN, good: ADJ, schools: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, or: CCONJ, get: VERB, ahead: ADV, .: PUNCT
S15: Crumbs: NOUN, for: ADP, the: DET, bottom: NOUN, :: PUNCT, The: DET, bottom: ADJ, layer: NOUN, often: ADV, gets: VERB, the: DET, leftovers: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S16: Jobs: NOUN, are: AUX, scarce: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, healthcare: VERB, a: DET, distant: ADJ, dream: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, basic: ADJ, needs: NOUN, barely: ADV, met: VERB, .: PUNCT
S17: It: PRON, 's: AUX, hard: ADJ, to: PART, climb: VERB, out: ADP, of: ADP, this: DET, layer: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, making: VERB, it: PRON, feel: VERB, like: ADP, a: DET, trap: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S18: This: DET, uneven: ADJ, distribution: NOUN, of: ADP, resources: NOUN, has: VERB, ripple: ADJ, effects: NOUN, :: PUNCT, 

: SPACE, Limited: ADJ, mobility: NOUN, :: PUNCT, When: SCONJ, the: DET, cake: NOUN, layers: NOUN, are: AUX, rigid: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, it: PRON, 's: AUX, hard: ADJ, for: SCONJ, people: NOUN, to: PART, move: VERB, from: ADP, one: NUM, to: ADP, another: PRON, .: PUNCT
S19: Stuck: ADJ, in: ADP, the: DET, bottom: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, their: PRON, potential: NOUN, might: AUX, go: VERB, untapped: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S20: Social: ADJ, tension: NOUN, :: PUNCT, Inequality: PROPN, can: AUX, breed: VERB, resentment: NOUN, and: CCONJ, conflict: NOUN, between: ADP, layers: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S21: Imagine: VERB, the: DET, top: ADJ, hoarding: NOUN, all: DET, the: DET, frosting: NOUN, while: SCONJ, the: DET, bottom: ADJ, scrapes: NOUN, for: ADP, crumbs: NOUN, –: PUNCT, not: PART, a: DET, recipe: NOUN, for: ADP, a: DET, happy: ADJ, party: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S22: Blocked: VERB, opportunities: NOUN, :: PUNCT, If: SCONJ, only: ADV, half: DET, the: DET, party: NOUN, gets: VERB, to: PART, bake: VERB, the: DET, cake: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, that: PRON, 's: AUX, a: DET, lot: NOUN, of: ADP, talent: NOUN, wasted: VERB, .: PUNCT
S23: Societies: NOUN, built: VERB, on: ADP, unfair: ADJ, stratification: NOUN, miss: VERB, out: ADP, on: ADP, the: DET, full: ADJ, potential: NOUN, of: ADP, all: PRON, their: PRON, members: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S24: So: ADV, ,: PUNCT, what: PRON, can: AUX, we: PRON, do: VERB, about: ADP, this: DET, lopsided: ADJ, cake: NOUN, ?: PUNCT
S25: Spread: VERB, the: DET, frosting: VERB, :: PUNCT, Policies: NOUN, that: PRON, promote: VERB, education: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, equal: ADJ, opportunities: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, fair: ADJ, wages: NOUN, can: AUX, help: VERB, shrink: VERB, the: DET, gaps: NOUN, between: ADP, layers: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S26: Bake: VERB, a: DET, new: ADJ, cake: NOUN, :: PUNCT, Building: VERB, a: DET, society: NOUN, where: SCONJ, everyone: PRON, has: VERB, a: DET, chance: NOUN, at: ADP, a: DET, decent: ADJ, slice: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, regardless: ADV, of: ADP, their: PRON, background: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, is: AUX, the: DET, ultimate: ADJ, goal: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S27: It: PRON, 's: AUX, not: PART, easy: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, remember: VERB, ,: PUNCT, even: ADV, the: DET, fanciest: ADJ, cake: NOUN, started: VERB, with: ADP, simple: ADJ, ingredients: NOUN, and: CCONJ, careful: ADJ, mixing: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S28: With: ADP, the: DET, right: ADJ, recipe: NOUN, and: CCONJ, a: DET, bit: NOUN, of: ADP, effort: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, we: PRON, can: AUX, bake: VERB, a: DET, more: ADV, equitable: ADJ, society: NOUN, where: SCONJ, everyone: PRON, gets: VERB, to: PART, enjoy: VERB, a: DET, sweet: ADJ, slice: NOUN, of: ADP, life: NOUN, .: PUNCT
