S1: Explain: VERB, the: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, social: ADJ, stratification: NOUN, and: CCONJ, its: PRON, impact: NOUN, on: ADP, societies: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Ans-: CCONJ, 
: SPACE, Social: ADJ, stratification: NOUN, is: AUX, kind: ADV, of: ADV, like: ADP, a: DET, team: NOUN, hierarchy: NOUN, in: ADP, a: DET, big: ADJ, project: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Different: ADJ, people: NOUN, have: VERB, different: ADJ, roles: NOUN, and: CCONJ, responsibilities: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, some: DET, roles: NOUN, come: VERB, with: ADP, more: ADJ, perks: NOUN, and: CCONJ, authority: NOUN, than: ADP, others: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: In: ADP, society: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, instead: ADV, of: ADP, roles: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, it: PRON, 's: AUX, more: ADJ, about: ADP, factors: NOUN, like: ADP, income: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, education: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, family: NOUN, background: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, or: CCONJ, even: ADV, things: NOUN, like: ADP, race: NOUN, or: CCONJ, gender: NOUN, that: PRON, determine: VERB, your: PRON, ": PUNCT, position: NOUN, ": PUNCT, in: ADP, the: DET, hierarchy: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Being: AUX, higher: ADV, up: ADP, generally: ADV, means: VERB, having: VERB, better: ADJ, access: NOUN, to: ADP, opportunities: NOUN, and: CCONJ, resources: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Think: VERB, of: ADP, it: PRON, like: ADP, having: VERB, access: NOUN, to: ADP, exclusive: ADJ, tools: NOUN, and: CCONJ, resources: NOUN, that: PRON, make: VERB, completing: VERB, the: DET, project: NOUN, easier: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S7: But: CCONJ, the: DET, lower: ADJ, you: PRON, are: AUX, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, fewer: ADJ, tools: NOUN, and: CCONJ, resources: NOUN, you: PRON, have: VERB, ,: PUNCT, making: VERB, things: NOUN, more: ADV, challenging: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S8: This: DET, hierarchy: NOUN, can: AUX, have: VERB, a: DET, big: ADJ, impact: NOUN, on: ADP, people: NOUN, 's: PART, lives: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: Those: PRON, at: ADP, the: DET, top: ADJ, tend: VERB, to: PART, have: VERB, better: ADJ, health: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, education: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, overall: ADJ, well: NOUN, -: PUNCT, being: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, just: ADV, like: ADP, someone: PRON, with: ADP, the: DET, best: ADJ, tools: NOUN, is: AUX, likely: ADJ, to: PART, do: VERB, well: ADV, in: ADP, the: DET, project: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: However: ADV, ,: PUNCT, those: PRON, lower: ADV, down: ADV, often: ADV, face: VERB, more: ADJ, obstacles: NOUN, and: CCONJ, disadvantages: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, making: VERB, it: PRON, harder: ADJ, for: SCONJ, them: PRON, to: PART, succeed: VERB, .: PUNCT
S11: Social: ADJ, stratification: NOUN, is: AUX, a: DET, complex: ADJ, issue: NOUN, with: ADP, no: DET, easy: ADJ, solutions: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, understanding: VERB, it: PRON, is: AUX, important: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S12: It: PRON, helps: VERB, us: PRON, see: VERB, how: SCONJ, society: NOUN, works: VERB, and: CCONJ, the: DET, different: ADJ, experiences: NOUN, people: NOUN, have: AUX, based: VERB, on: ADP, their: PRON, position: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S13: This: DET, awareness: NOUN, can: AUX, lead: VERB, to: ADP, discussions: NOUN, about: ADP, fairness: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, equality: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, how: SCONJ, we: PRON, can: AUX, create: VERB, a: DET, society: NOUN, where: SCONJ, everyone: PRON, has: VERB, a: DET, chance: NOUN, to: PART, thrive: VERB, ,: PUNCT, regardless: ADV, of: ADP, their: PRON, starting: NOUN, point: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, hierarchy: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S14: Remember: VERB, ,: PUNCT, everyone: PRON, deserves: VERB, a: DET, chance: NOUN, to: PART, contribute: VERB, and: CCONJ, succeed: VERB, ,: PUNCT, just: ADV, like: SCONJ, everyone: PRON, deserves: VERB, a: DET, chance: NOUN, to: PART, use: VERB, the: DET, best: ADJ, tools: NOUN, and: CCONJ, resources: NOUN, on: ADP, the: DET, project: NOUN, !: PUNCT
