S1: Explain: VERB, the: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, social: ADJ, stratification: NOUN, and: CCONJ, its: PRON, impact: NOUN, on: ADP, societies: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Ans-: CCONJ, 
: SPACE, Social: ADJ, stratification: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, like: ADP, a: DET, geological: ADJ, layer: NOUN, cake: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, divides: VERB, societies: NOUN, into: ADP, tiers: NOUN, based: VERB, on: ADP, factors: NOUN, like: ADP, wealth: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, power: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, education: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, even: ADV, race: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Imagine: NOUN, layers: NOUN, stacked: VERB, high: ADV, ,: PUNCT, with: SCONJ, privilege: NOUN, and: CCONJ, opportunity: NOUN, concentrated: VERB, at: ADP, the: DET, top: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, diminishing: VERB, as: SCONJ, you: PRON, descend: VERB, .: PUNCT
S4: This: DET, uneven: ADJ, distribution: NOUN, shapes: NOUN, every: DET, aspect: NOUN, of: ADP, life: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, influencing: VERB, access: NOUN, to: ADP, healthcare: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, education: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, even: ADV, life: NOUN, expectancy: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: The: DET, impact: NOUN, of: ADP, stratification: NOUN, is: AUX, far: ADV, -: PUNCT, reaching: VERB, .: PUNCT
S6: It: PRON, affects: VERB, who: PRON, gets: VERB, heard: VERB, ,: PUNCT, who: PRON, wields: VERB, influence: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, who: PRON, faces: VERB, discrimination: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: It: PRON, can: AUX, limit: VERB, social: ADJ, mobility: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, trapping: VERB, individuals: NOUN, and: CCONJ, entire: ADJ, groups: NOUN, in: ADP, cycles: NOUN, of: ADP, disadvantage: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: Education: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, often: ADV, the: DET, key: NOUN, to: ADP, upward: ADJ, mobility: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, becomes: VERB, less: ADV, accessible: ADJ, with: ADP, each: DET, descending: VERB, layer: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, perpetuating: VERB, the: DET, stratification: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: This: PRON, can: AUX, fuel: VERB, social: ADJ, unrest: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, resentment: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, even: ADV, violence: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: However: ADV, ,: PUNCT, not: PART, all: DET, stratification: NOUN, is: AUX, rigid: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S11: Movements: NOUN, for: ADP, social: ADJ, justice: NOUN, strive: VERB, to: PART, flatten: VERB, the: DET, cake: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, dismantling: VERB, barriers: NOUN, and: CCONJ, advocating: VERB, for: ADP, equal: ADJ, opportunities: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: Education: NOUN, reform: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, affirmative: ADJ, action: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, progressive: ADJ, taxation: NOUN, are: AUX, tools: NOUN, used: VERB, to: PART, chip: VERB, away: ADV, at: ADP, inequalities: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S13: Recognizing: VERB, the: DET, impact: NOUN, of: ADP, social: ADJ, stratification: NOUN, is: AUX, the: DET, first: ADJ, step: NOUN, towards: ADP, building: VERB, a: DET, more: ADV, equitable: ADJ, and: CCONJ, just: ADV, society: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, where: SCONJ, everyone: PRON, has: VERB, the: DET, chance: NOUN, to: PART, climb: VERB, the: DET, ladder: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, not: PART, just: ADV, those: PRON, born: VERB, at: ADP, the: DET, top: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S14: So: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, next: ADJ, time: NOUN, you: PRON, see: VERB, a: DET, homeless: ADJ, person: NOUN, begging: VERB, on: ADP, the: DET, street: NOUN, or: CCONJ, a: DET, CEO: NOUN, stepping: VERB, out: ADP, of: ADP, a: DET, limousine: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, remember: VERB, ,: PUNCT, they: PRON, exist: VERB, in: ADP, different: ADJ, layers: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, same: ADJ, society: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, shaped: VERB, by: ADP, the: DET, invisible: ADJ, lines: NOUN, of: ADP, social: ADJ, stratification: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S15: And: CCONJ, it: PRON, 's: AUX, up: ADP, to: ADP, us: PRON, ,: PUNCT, collectively: ADV, ,: PUNCT, to: PART, decide: VERB, what: PRON, kind: NOUN, of: ADP, cake: NOUN, we: PRON, want: VERB, to: PART, bake: VERB, for: ADP, our: PRON, future: NOUN, .: PUNCT
