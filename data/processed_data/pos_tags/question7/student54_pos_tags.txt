S7: RDBMSs: NOUN, are: AUX, used: VERB, to: PART, store: VERB, product: NOUN, information: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, inventory: NOUN, levels: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, production: NOUN, data: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: RDBMSs: NOUN, enforce: VERB, data: NOUN, integrity: NOUN, rules: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, which: PRON, help: VERB, to: PART, ensure: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, data: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, database: NOUN, is: AUX, accurate: ADJ, and: CCONJ, consistent: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S9: Data: NOUN, security: NOUN, :: PUNCT, RDBMSs: NOUN, provide: VERB, a: DET, variety: NOUN, of: ADP, security: NOUN, features: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, such: ADJ, as: ADP, access: NOUN, control: NOUN, and: CCONJ, encryption: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, to: PART, help: VERB, protect: VERB, the: DET, data: NOUN, from: ADP, unauthorized: ADJ, access: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: RDBMSs: NOUN, can: AUX, be: AUX, scaled: VERB, to: PART, accommodate: VERB, large: ADJ, amounts: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, and: CCONJ, aslo: PROPN, be: AUX, used: VERB, to: PART, store: VERB, a: DET, wide: ADJ, variety: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, types: NOUN, .: PUNCT
