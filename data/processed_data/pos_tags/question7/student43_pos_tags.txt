S1: What: PRON, are: AUX, the: DET, main: ADJ, components: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, relational: ADJ, database: NOUN, management: NOUN, system: NOUN, (: PUNCT, RDBMS),and: ADV, how: SCONJ, do: AUX, they: PRON, facilitate: VERB, efficient: ADJ, data: NOUN, organization: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, ?: PUNCT
S2: Ans-: CCONJ, 
: SPACE, A: DET, Relational: PROPN, Database: PROPN, Management: PROPN, System: PROPN, (: PUNCT, RDBMS: PROPN, ): PUNCT, is: AUX, comprised: VERB, of: ADP, crucial: ADJ, components: NOUN, that: PRON, collaborate: VERB, to: PART, streamline: VERB, the: DET, organization: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: At: ADP, its: PRON, core: NOUN, are: AUX, tables: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, which: PRON, serve: VERB, as: ADP, the: DET, foundational: ADJ, structure: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, arranging: VERB, information: NOUN, into: ADP, rows: NOUN, and: CCONJ, columns: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Each: DET, table: NOUN, represents: VERB, a: DET, unique: ADJ, entity: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, with: ADP, rows: NOUN, encapsulating: VERB, individual: ADJ, data: NOUN, entries: NOUN, and: CCONJ, columns: NOUN, specifying: VERB, distinct: ADJ, attributes: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Primary: ADJ, keys: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, acting: VERB, as: ADP, exclusive: ADJ, identifiers: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, ensure: VERB, data: NOUN, integrity: NOUN, and: CCONJ, form: VERB, the: DET, basis: NOUN, for: ADP, establishing: VERB, relationships: NOUN, between: ADP, tables: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Foreign: ADJ, keys: NOUN, enhance: VERB, connectivity: NOUN, by: ADP, referencing: VERB, primary: ADJ, keys: NOUN, of: ADP, other: ADJ, tables: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, facilitating: VERB, associations: NOUN, between: ADP, different: ADJ, entities: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, database: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Indexes: NOUN, act: VERB, as: ADP, expedited: VERB, retrieval: NOUN, tools: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, optimizing: VERB, search: NOUN, processes: NOUN, by: ADP, applying: VERB, them: PRON, to: ADP, specific: ADJ, columns: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: The: DET, normalization: NOUN, process: NOUN, systematically: ADV, organizes: VERB, data: NOUN, into: ADP, interrelated: ADJ, tables: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, mitigating: VERB, redundancy: NOUN, and: CCONJ, enhancing: VERB, overall: ADJ, database: NOUN, efficiency: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: This: DET, orchestrated: ADJ, system: NOUN, operates: VERB, within: ADP, the: DET, standardized: ADJ, language: NOUN, of: ADP, SQL: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, empowering: VERB, users: NOUN, with: ADP, commands: NOUN, like: ADP, SELECT: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, INSERT: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, UPDATE: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, DELETE: PROPN, for: ADP, seamless: ADJ, data: NOUN, manipulation: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: Together: ADV, ,: PUNCT, these: DET, integral: ADJ, components: NOUN, forge: VERB, a: DET, cohesive: ADJ, framework: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, enabling: VERB, the: DET, RDBMS: NOUN, to: PART, efficiently: ADV, manage: VERB, and: CCONJ, access: NOUN, data: NOUN, with: ADP, precision: NOUN, and: CCONJ, reliability: NOUN, .: PUNCT
