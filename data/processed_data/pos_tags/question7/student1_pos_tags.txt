S1: A: DET, Relational: PROPN, Database: PROPN, Management: PROPN, System: PROPN, (: PUNCT, RDBMS: PROPN, ): PUNCT, consists: VERB, of: ADP, several: ADJ, key: ADJ, components: NOUN, that: PRON, facilitate: VERB, efficient: ADJ, data: NOUN, organization: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Firstly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, tables: NOUN, serve: VERB, as: ADP, the: DET, primary: ADJ, storage: NOUN, structures: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, organizing: VERB, data: NOUN, into: ADP, rows: NOUN, and: CCONJ, columns: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Each: DET, table: NOUN, represents: VERB, a: DET, specific: ADJ, entity: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, relationships: NOUN, between: ADP, tables: NOUN, are: AUX, established: VERB, through: ADP, keys: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, ensuring: VERB, data: NOUN, integrity: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: The: DET, second: ADJ, component: NOUN, is: AUX, rows: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, representing: VERB, individual: ADJ, records: NOUN, within: ADP, a: DET, table: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, columns: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, defining: VERB, the: DET, attributes: NOUN, or: CCONJ, fields: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, records: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: This: DET, tabular: ADJ, structure: NOUN, allows: VERB, for: ADP, the: DET, systematic: ADJ, storage: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, ensuring: VERB, consistency: NOUN, and: CCONJ, ease: NOUN, of: ADP, retrieval: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: The: DET, third: ADJ, component: NOUN, is: AUX, keys: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, with: ADP, primary: ADJ, keys: NOUN, uniquely: ADV, identifying: VERB, each: DET, record: NOUN, within: ADP, a: DET, table: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, ensuring: VERB, data: NOUN, integrity: NOUN, and: CCONJ, enabling: VERB, efficient: ADJ, data: NOUN, retrieval: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Foreign: ADJ, keys: NOUN, establish: VERB, relationships: NOUN, between: ADP, tables: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, allowing: VERB, for: ADP, the: DET, normalization: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, and: CCONJ, reducing: VERB, redundancy: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: Indexes: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, fourth: ADJ, component: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, enhance: VERB, data: NOUN, retrieval: NOUN, speed: NOUN, by: ADP, providing: VERB, a: DET, structured: ADJ, mechanism: NOUN, for: ADP, locating: VERB, specific: ADJ, records: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: Indexing: NOUN, involves: VERB, creating: VERB, a: DET, separate: ADJ, data: NOUN, structure: NOUN, that: PRON, references: VERB, the: DET, location: NOUN, of: ADP, records: NOUN, based: VERB, on: ADP, specific: ADJ, columns: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, optimizing: VERB, query: NOUN, performance: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: The: DET, fifth: ADJ, component: NOUN, is: AUX, SQL: PROPN, (: PUNCT, Structured: PROPN, Query: PROPN, Language: PROPN, ): PUNCT, ,: PUNCT, which: PRON, is: AUX, used: VERB, to: PART, interact: VERB, with: ADP, the: DET, RDBMS: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: SQL: PROPN, enables: VERB, users: NOUN, to: PART, define: VERB, ,: PUNCT, manipulate: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, query: VERB, the: DET, database: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, providing: VERB, a: DET, standardized: ADJ, and: CCONJ, powerful: ADJ, interface: NOUN, for: ADP, managing: VERB, data: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: Transactions: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, sixth: ADJ, component: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, ensure: VERB, data: NOUN, consistency: NOUN, and: CCONJ, integrity: NOUN, by: ADP, grouping: VERB, database: NOUN, operations: NOUN, into: ADP, atomic: ADJ, units: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S13: This: PRON, ensures: VERB, that: SCONJ, either: CCONJ, all: DET, operations: NOUN, within: ADP, a: DET, transaction: NOUN, are: AUX, executed: VERB, ,: PUNCT, or: CCONJ, none: NOUN, at: ADV, all: ADV, ,: PUNCT, preventing: VERB, partial: ADJ, updates: NOUN, and: CCONJ, maintaining: VERB, data: NOUN, accuracy: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S14: Security: NOUN, mechanisms: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, seventh: ADJ, component: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, control: NOUN, access: NOUN, to: ADP, the: DET, database: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, enforcing: VERB, authentication: NOUN, and: CCONJ, authorization: NOUN, policies: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S15: This: PRON, helps: VERB, protect: VERB, sensitive: ADJ, information: NOUN, and: CCONJ, ensures: VERB, that: SCONJ, only: ADV, authorized: VERB, users: NOUN, can: AUX, interact: VERB, with: ADP, the: DET, data: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S16: Concurrency: NOUN, control: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, eighth: ADJ, component: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, manages: VERB, simultaneous: ADJ, access: NOUN, to: ADP, the: DET, database: NOUN, by: ADP, multiple: ADJ, users: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, preventing: VERB, conflicts: NOUN, and: CCONJ, ensuring: VERB, that: SCONJ, transactions: NOUN, are: AUX, processed: VERB, coherently: ADV, .: PUNCT
S17: This: PRON, is: AUX, crucial: ADJ, for: ADP, maintaining: VERB, data: NOUN, consistency: NOUN, in: ADP, a: DET, multi: ADJ, -: NOUN, user: ADJ, environment: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S18: Backup: ADJ, and: CCONJ, recovery: NOUN, mechanisms: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, ninth: ADJ, component: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, safeguard: NOUN, against: ADP, data: NOUN, loss: NOUN, by: ADP, creating: VERB, periodic: ADJ, backups: NOUN, and: CCONJ, providing: VERB, mechanisms: NOUN, for: ADP, restoring: VERB, the: DET, database: NOUN, to: ADP, a: DET, previous: ADJ, state: NOUN, in: ADP, case: NOUN, of: ADP, errors: NOUN, or: CCONJ, failures: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S19: Lastly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, tenth: ADJ, component: NOUN, is: AUX, normalization: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, a: DET, process: NOUN, that: PRON, minimizes: PRON, data: NOUN, redundancy: NOUN, by: ADP, organizing: VERB, tables: NOUN, to: PART, eliminate: VERB, duplicate: ADJ, information: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S20: Normalization: NOUN, enhances: VERB, data: NOUN, integrity: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, simplifies: NOUN, maintenance: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, contributes: VERB, to: ADP, efficient: ADJ, data: NOUN, storage: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, relational: ADJ, database: NOUN, management: NOUN, system: NOUN, .: PUNCT
