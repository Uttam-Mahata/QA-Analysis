: SPACE, A: DET, Relational: PROPN, Database: PROPN, Management: PROPN, System: PROPN, (: PUNCT, RDBMS: PROPN, ): PUNCT, consists: VERB, of: ADP, various: ADJ, components: NOUN, that: PRON, aim: VERB, to: PART, organize: VERB, and: CCONJ, retrieve: VERB, data: NOUN, efficiently: ADV, .: PUNCT
S2: Firstly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, tables: NOUN, act: VERB, as: ADP, the: DET, primary: ADJ, storage: NOUN, structures: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, organizing: VERB, data: NOUN, into: ADP, rows: NOUN, and: CCONJ, columns: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: However: ADV, ,: PUNCT, these: DET, tables: NOUN, often: ADV, lead: VERB, to: ADP, data: NOUN, redundancy: NOUN, and: CCONJ, inefficiencies: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Rows: NOUN, and: CCONJ, columns: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, forming: VERB, the: DET, second: ADJ, component: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, represent: VERB, individual: ADJ, records: NOUN, and: CCONJ, their: PRON, attributes: NOUN, within: ADP, a: DET, table: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: While: SCONJ, this: DET, tabular: ADJ, structure: NOUN, simplifies: NOUN, data: NOUN, organization: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, it: PRON, can: AUX, become: VERB, unwieldy: ADJ, and: CCONJ, challenging: VERB, to: PART, manage: VERB, in: ADP, complex: ADJ, scenarios: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Keys: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, third: ADJ, component: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, include: VERB, primary: ADJ, keys: NOUN, for: ADP, unique: ADJ, record: NOUN, identification: NOUN, and: CCONJ, foreign: ADJ, keys: NOUN, to: PART, establish: VERB, relationships: NOUN, between: ADP, tables: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Despite: SCONJ, their: PRON, intended: VERB, roles: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, keys: NOUN, can: AUX, sometimes: ADV, lead: VERB, to: ADP, data: NOUN, inconsistencies: NOUN, and: CCONJ, require: VERB, careful: ADJ, management: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: Indexes: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, fourth: ADJ, component: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, improve: VERB, data: NOUN, retrieval: NOUN, speed: NOUN, by: ADP, creating: VERB, structured: ADJ, access: NOUN, points: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: However: ADV, ,: PUNCT, excessive: ADJ, indexing: NOUN, can: AUX, lead: VERB, to: ADP, increased: VERB, storage: NOUN, requirements: NOUN, and: CCONJ, slower: ADJ, write: NOUN, operations: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: Structured: PROPN, Query: PROPN, Language: PROPN, (: PUNCT, SQL: PROPN, ): PUNCT, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, fifth: ADJ, component: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, is: AUX, a: DET, standardized: ADJ, language: NOUN, for: ADP, interacting: VERB, with: ADP, the: DET, RDBMS: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: While: SCONJ, SQL: PROPN, provides: VERB, a: DET, common: ADJ, interface: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, its: PRON, syntax: NOUN, complexities: NOUN, and: CCONJ, variations: NOUN, can: AUX, pose: VERB, challenges: NOUN, for: ADP, users: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: Transactions: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, sixth: ADJ, component: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, ensure: VERB, data: NOUN, consistency: NOUN, by: ADP, grouping: VERB, operations: NOUN, into: ADP, atomic: ADJ, units: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S13: However: ADV, ,: PUNCT, transaction: NOUN, management: NOUN, can: AUX, introduce: VERB, overhead: ADV, and: CCONJ, potentially: ADV, impact: NOUN, system: NOUN, performance: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S14: Security: NOUN, mechanisms: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, seventh: ADJ, component: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, control: NOUN, access: NOUN, to: ADP, the: DET, database: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S15: Yet: ADV, ,: PUNCT, enforcing: VERB, security: NOUN, measures: NOUN, can: AUX, lead: VERB, to: ADP, administrative: ADJ, complexities: NOUN, and: CCONJ, hinder: NOUN, user: NOUN, flexibility: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S16: Concurrency: NOUN, control: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, eighth: ADJ, component: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, manages: VERB, simultaneous: ADJ, access: NOUN, to: ADP, the: DET, database: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S17: However: ADV, ,: PUNCT, implementing: VERB, effective: ADJ, concurrency: NOUN, control: NOUN, mechanisms: NOUN, can: AUX, be: AUX, complex: ADJ, and: CCONJ, resource: NOUN, -: PUNCT, intensive: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S18: Backup: ADJ, and: CCONJ, recovery: NOUN, mechanisms: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, ninth: ADJ, component: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, safeguard: NOUN, against: ADP, data: NOUN, loss: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S19: However: ADV, ,: PUNCT, depending: VERB, solely: ADV, on: ADP, backups: NOUN, may: AUX, not: PART, guarantee: VERB, real: ADJ, -: PUNCT, time: NOUN, recovery: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, leading: VERB, to: ADP, potential: ADJ, data: NOUN, inconsistencies: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S20: Normalization: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, tenth: ADJ, component: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, minimizes: NOUN, data: NOUN, redundancy: NOUN, by: ADP, organizing: VERB, tables: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S21: However: ADV, ,: PUNCT, excessive: ADJ, normalization: NOUN, can: AUX, complicate: VERB, queries: NOUN, and: CCONJ, hinder: NOUN, performance: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S22: In: ADP, essence: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, components: NOUN, of: ADP, an: DET, RDBMS: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, while: SCONJ, aiming: VERB, for: ADP, efficiency: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, often: ADV, introduce: VERB, complexities: NOUN, and: CCONJ, trade: NOUN, -: PUNCT, offs: NOUN, in: ADP, practical: ADJ, implementations: NOUN, .: PUNCT
