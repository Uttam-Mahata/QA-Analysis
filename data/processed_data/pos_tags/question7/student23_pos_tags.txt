S1: A: DET, Relational: PROPN, Database: PROPN, Management: PROPN, System: PROPN, (: PUNCT, RDBMS: PROPN, ): PUNCT, is: AUX, composed: VERB, of: ADP, various: ADJ, integral: ADJ, components: NOUN, working: VERB, in: ADP, tandem: NOUN, to: ADP, facilitate: VERB, efficient: ADJ, data: NOUN, organization: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Tables: NOUN, serve: VERB, as: ADP, the: DET, fundamental: ADJ, structure: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, organizing: VERB, data: NOUN, into: ADP, rows: NOUN, and: CCONJ, columns: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, where: SCONJ, each: DET, row: NOUN, corresponds: VERB, to: ADP, a: DET, specific: ADJ, record: NOUN, and: CCONJ, each: DET, column: NOUN, defines: VERB, an: DET, attribute: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Keys: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, both: PRON, primary: ADJ, and: CCONJ, foreign: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, establish: VERB, relationships: NOUN, between: ADP, tables: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, ensuring: VERB, data: NOUN, integrity: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Indexes: NOUN, enhance: VERB, retrieval: NOUN, speed: NOUN, by: ADP, providing: VERB, quick: ADJ, references: NOUN, to: ADP, specific: ADJ, data: NOUN, locations: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Queries: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, formulated: VERB, in: ADP, SQL: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, enable: VERB, users: NOUN, to: PART, interact: VERB, with: ADP, the: DET, RDBMS: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, allowing: VERB, for: ADP, data: NOUN, manipulation: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: This: DET, structured: ADJ, approach: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, coupled: VERB, with: ADP, the: DET, relational: ADJ, model: NOUN, 's: PART, design: NOUN, principles: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, ensures: VERB, systematic: ADJ, and: CCONJ, organized: VERB, management: NOUN, of: ADP, large: ADJ, datasets: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, making: VERB, it: PRON, adept: ADJ, at: ADP, handling: VERB, complex: ADJ, relationships: NOUN, and: CCONJ, supporting: VERB, optimized: VERB, search: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, operations: NOUN, .: PUNCT
