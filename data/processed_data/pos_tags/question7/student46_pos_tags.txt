: SPACE, The: DET, main: ADJ, components: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, relational: ADJ, database: NOUN, management: NOUN, system: NOUN, (: PUNCT, RDBMS: PROPN, ): PUNCT, include: VERB, tables: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, tuples: NOUN, (: PUNCT, records: NOUN, ): PUNCT, ,: PUNCT, columns: NOUN, (: PUNCT, attributes: NOUN, ): PUNCT, ,: PUNCT, domains: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, schemas: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, keys: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Tables: NOUN, are: AUX, used: VERB, to: PART, store: VERB, related: ADJ, data: NOUN, elements: NOUN, in: ADP, a: DET, row: NOUN, -: PUNCT, based: VERB, structure: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, with: ADP, each: DET, row: NOUN, representing: VERB, a: DET, record: NOUN, or: CCONJ, tuple: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, each: DET, column: NOUN, representing: VERB, an: DET, attribute: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Domains: NOUN, describe: VERB, the: DET, possible: ADJ, values: NOUN, that: PRON, a: DET, column: NOUN, can: AUX, hold: VERB, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, schemas: NOUN, are: AUX, used: VERB, to: PART, logically: ADV, group: VERB, related: VERB, database: NOUN, objects: VERB, together: ADV, .: PUNCT
S5: Keys: NOUN, are: AUX, used: VERB, to: PART, identify: VERB, each: DET, record: NOUN, in: ADP, a: DET, table: NOUN, and: CCONJ, ensure: VERB, data: NOUN, integrity: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: These: DET, components: NOUN, facilitate: VERB, efficient: ADJ, data: NOUN, organization: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, by: ADP, providing: VERB, a: DET, structured: ADJ, framework: NOUN, for: ADP, storing: VERB, and: CCONJ, managing: VERB, data: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: The: DET, use: NOUN, of: ADP, tables: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, records: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, attributes: NOUN, allows: VERB, for: ADP, the: DET, systematic: ADJ, organization: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, making: VERB, it: PRON, easier: ADJ, to: PART, store: VERB, and: CCONJ, retrieve: VERB, information: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: Additionally: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, use: NOUN, of: ADP, keys: NOUN, and: CCONJ, domains: NOUN, helps: VERB, ensure: VERB, the: DET, accuracy: NOUN, and: CCONJ, integrity: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, data: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, which: PRON, is: AUX, essential: ADJ, for: ADP, efficient: ADJ, retrieval: NOUN, and: CCONJ, manipulation: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: Overall: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, components: NOUN, of: ADP, an: DET, RDBMS: NOUN, work: NOUN, together: ADV, to: PART, provide: VERB, a: DET, reliable: ADJ, and: CCONJ, organized: VERB, method: NOUN, for: ADP, storing: VERB, and: CCONJ, retrieving: VERB, large: ADJ, amounts: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, making: VERB, it: PRON, an: DET, essential: ADJ, tool: NOUN, for: ADP, businesses: NOUN, and: CCONJ, organizations[1][2][4: NOUN, ]: PUNCT, .: PUNCT
