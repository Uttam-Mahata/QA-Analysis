S1: A: DET, Relational: PROPN, Database: PROPN, Management: PROPN, System: PROPN, (: PUNCT, RDBMS: PROPN, ): PUNCT, consists: VERB, of: ADP, essential: ADJ, components: NOUN, that: PRON, collaboratively: ADV, facilitate: VERB, efficient: ADJ, data: NOUN, organization: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Tables: NOUN, serve: VERB, as: ADP, the: DET, foundational: ADJ, structures: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, organizing: VERB, data: NOUN, into: ADP, rows: NOUN, and: CCONJ, columns: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Rows: NOUN, represent: VERB, individual: ADJ, records: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, while: SCONJ, columns: NOUN, define: VERB, the: DET, attributes: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, data: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Keys: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, including: VERB, primary: ADJ, and: CCONJ, foreign: ADJ, keys: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, establish: VERB, relationships: NOUN, between: ADP, tables: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, ensuring: VERB, data: NOUN, integrity: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Indexes: NOUN, enhance: VERB, retrieval: NOUN, speed: NOUN, by: ADP, providing: VERB, quick: ADJ, references: NOUN, to: ADP, specific: ADJ, data: NOUN, locations: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Users: NOUN, interact: VERB, with: ADP, the: DET, RDBMS: NOUN, through: ADP, SQL: PROPN, queries: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, allowing: VERB, for: ADP, seamless: ADJ, data: NOUN, manipulation: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Together: ADV, ,: PUNCT, these: DET, components: NOUN, enforce: VERB, structure: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, relationships: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, optimization: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, enabling: VERB, the: DET, RDBMS: NOUN, to: PART, systematically: ADV, handle: VERB, extensive: ADJ, datasets: NOUN, and: CCONJ, intricate: ADJ, data: NOUN, relationships: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: The: DET, adherence: NOUN, to: ADP, relational: ADJ, model: NOUN, principles: NOUN, further: ADV, contributes: VERB, to: ADP, the: DET, overall: ADJ, effectiveness: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, system: NOUN, in: ADP, managing: VERB, and: CCONJ, retrieving: VERB, data: NOUN, .: PUNCT
