S1: Relational: PROPN, Database: PROPN, Management: PROPN, Systems: PROPN, (: PUNCT, RDBMS: PROPN, ): PUNCT, facilitate: NOUN, efficient: ADJ, data: NOUN, organization: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, through: ADP, their: PRON, structured: ADJ, design: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: One: NUM, key: ADJ, aspect: NOUN, is: AUX, the: DET, use: NOUN, of: ADP, tables: NOUN, to: PART, organize: VERB, data: NOUN, in: ADP, a: DET, structured: ADJ, format: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Tables: NOUN, consist: VERB, of: ADP, rows: NOUN, and: CCONJ, columns: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, providing: VERB, a: DET, clear: ADJ, and: CCONJ, systematic: ADJ, way: NOUN, to: PART, store: VERB, information: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: This: DET, tabular: ADJ, structure: NOUN, enables: VERB, easy: ADJ, categorization: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, based: VERB, on: ADP, defined: VERB, attributes: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, contributing: VERB, to: ADP, efficient: ADJ, organization: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Data: NOUN, types: NOUN, play: VERB, a: DET, crucial: ADJ, role: NOUN, in: ADP, defining: VERB, the: DET, nature: NOUN, of: ADP, information: NOUN, stored: VERB, in: ADP, each: DET, column: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: By: ADP, specifying: VERB, data: NOUN, types: NOUN, such: ADJ, as: ADP, integers: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, strings: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, dates: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, RDBMS: PROPN, ensures: VERB, consistency: NOUN, and: CCONJ, helps: VERB, in: ADP, optimizing: VERB, storage: NOUN, space: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: This: DET, standardized: ADJ, approach: NOUN, to: ADP, data: NOUN, representation: NOUN, enhances: VERB, the: DET, efficiency: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, retrieval: NOUN, and: CCONJ, processing: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: Indexes: NOUN, are: AUX, essential: ADJ, components: NOUN, that: PRON, act: VERB, as: ADP, a: DET, quick: ADJ, reference: NOUN, to: ADP, the: DET, location: NOUN, of: ADP, specific: ADJ, data: NOUN, within: ADP, the: DET, tables: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: By: ADP, creating: VERB, indexes: NOUN, on: ADP, columns: NOUN, frequently: ADV, used: VERB, in: ADP, queries: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, RDBMS: NOUN, accelerates: VERB, search: NOUN, operations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, reducing: VERB, the: DET, time: NOUN, required: VERB, to: PART, retrieve: VERB, relevant: ADJ, information: NOUN, .: PUNCT
