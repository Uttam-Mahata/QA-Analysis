S1: A: DET, Relational: PROPN, Database: PROPN, Management: PROPN, System: PROPN, (: PUNCT, RDBMS: PROPN, ): PUNCT, is: AUX, composed: VERB, of: ADP, essential: ADJ, components: NOUN, such: ADJ, as: ADP, tables: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, rows: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, columns: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, keys: NOUN, (: PUNCT, both: PRON, primary: ADJ, and: CCONJ, foreign: ADJ, ): PUNCT, ,: PUNCT, indexes: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, SQL: PROPN, queries: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, all: PRON, working: VERB, collaboratively: ADV, to: PART, streamline: VERB, efficient: ADJ, data: NOUN, organization: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Tables: NOUN, structure: NOUN, data: NOUN, systematically: ADV, ,: PUNCT, rows: NOUN, represent: VERB, individual: ADJ, records: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, columns: NOUN, define: VERB, attributes: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Keys: NOUN, establish: VERB, relationships: NOUN, between: ADP, tables: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, ensuring: VERB, data: NOUN, integrity: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, while: SCONJ, indexes: NOUN, optimize: VERB, retrieval: NOUN, speed: NOUN, by: ADP, providing: VERB, quick: ADJ, access: NOUN, to: ADP, specific: ADJ, data: NOUN, points: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: SQL: PROPN, queries: VERB, enable: VERB, users: NOUN, to: PART, interact: VERB, with: ADP, the: DET, RDBMS: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, allowing: VERB, for: ADP, seamless: ADJ, data: NOUN, manipulation: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: This: DET, integrated: ADJ, approach: NOUN, reduces: VERB, redundancy: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, enforces: NOUN, data: NOUN, integrity: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, supports: VERB, complex: ADJ, data: NOUN, relationships: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, making: VERB, the: DET, RDBMS: NOUN, a: DET, powerful: ADJ, tool: NOUN, for: ADP, organized: ADJ, and: CCONJ, swift: ADJ, data: NOUN, management: NOUN, .: PUNCT
