S1: A: DET, Relational: PROPN, Database: PROPN, Management: PROPN, System: PROPN, (: PUNCT, RDBMS: PROPN, ): PUNCT, consists: VERB, of: ADP, several: ADJ, key: ADJ, components: NOUN, that: PRON, work: VERB, together: ADV, to: PART, facilitate: VERB, efficient: ADJ, data: NOUN, organization: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: The: DET, main: ADJ, components: NOUN, include: VERB, tables: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, relationships: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, SQL: PROPN, (: PUNCT, Structured: PROPN, Query: PROPN, Language: PROPN, ): PUNCT, ,: PUNCT, indexes: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, transactions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Tables: NOUN, are: AUX, the: DET, fundamental: ADJ, building: NOUN, blocks: NOUN, of: ADP, an: DET, RDBMS: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, representing: VERB, entities: NOUN, or: CCONJ, objects: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, database: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Each: DET, table: NOUN, consists: VERB, of: ADP, rows: NOUN, and: CCONJ, columns: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, where: SCONJ, rows: NOUN, correspond: VERB, to: ADP, individual: ADJ, records: NOUN, and: CCONJ, columns: NOUN, represent: VERB, attributes: NOUN, or: CCONJ, fields: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Relationships: NOUN, establish: VERB, connections: NOUN, between: ADP, tables: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, defining: VERB, how: SCONJ, data: NOUN, in: ADP, one: NUM, table: NOUN, is: AUX, related: VERB, to: ADP, data: NOUN, in: ADP, another: PRON, .: PUNCT
S6: This: PRON, enables: VERB, the: DET, establishment: NOUN, of: ADP, meaningful: ADJ, associations: NOUN, between: ADP, different: ADJ, entities: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, supporting: VERB, data: NOUN, integrity: NOUN, and: CCONJ, reducing: VERB, redundancy: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: SQL: PROPN, is: AUX, a: DET, standardized: ADJ, language: NOUN, used: VERB, to: PART, interact: VERB, with: ADP, relational: ADJ, databases: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: It: PRON, allows: VERB, users: NOUN, to: PART, define: VERB, ,: PUNCT, manipulate: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, query: NOUN, data: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: SQL: PROPN, queries: NOUN, provide: VERB, a: DET, powerful: ADJ, and: CCONJ, flexible: ADJ, means: NOUN, to: PART, retrieve: VERB, specific: ADJ, information: NOUN, from: ADP, the: DET, database: NOUN, efficiently: ADV, .: PUNCT
S10: ndexes: NOUN, are: AUX, crucial: ADJ, for: ADP, optimizing: VERB, data: NOUN, retrieval: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: They: PRON, act: VERB, as: ADP, data: NOUN, structures: NOUN, that: PRON, enhance: VERB, the: DET, speed: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, retrieval: NOUN, operations: NOUN, by: ADP, creating: VERB, a: DET, quick: ADJ, lookup: NOUN, mechanism: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: Indexes: NOUN, are: AUX, typically: ADV, created: VERB, on: ADP, columns: NOUN, that: PRON, are: AUX, frequently: ADV, used: VERB, in: ADP, search: NOUN, conditions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
