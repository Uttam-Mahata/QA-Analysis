S1: A: DET, Relational: PROPN, Database: PROPN, Management: PROPN, System: PROPN, (: PUNCT, RDBMS: PROPN, ): PUNCT, consists: VERB, of: ADP, key: ADJ, components: NOUN, that: PRON, collectively: ADV, contribute: VERB, to: ADP, efficient: ADJ, data: NOUN, organization: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Firstly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, tables: NOUN, serve: VERB, as: ADP, the: DET, core: NOUN, structures: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, organizing: VERB, data: NOUN, into: ADP, rows: NOUN, and: CCONJ, columns: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Each: DET, row: NOUN, represents: VERB, a: DET, unique: ADJ, record: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, columns: NOUN, define: VERB, specific: ADJ, attributes: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Keys: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, including: VERB, primary: ADJ, and: CCONJ, foreign: ADJ, keys: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, establish: VERB, relationships: NOUN, between: ADP, tables: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, ensuring: VERB, data: NOUN, consistency: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Indexes: NOUN, enhance: VERB, retrieval: NOUN, speed: NOUN, by: ADP, creating: VERB, a: DET, quick: ADJ, reference: NOUN, to: ADP, data: NOUN, locations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, reducing: VERB, the: DET, time: NOUN, required: VERB, for: ADP, searches: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Queries: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, formulated: VERB, using: VERB, Structured: PROPN, Query: PROPN, Language: PROPN, (: PUNCT, SQL: PROPN, ): PUNCT, ,: PUNCT, enable: VERB, users: NOUN, to: PART, interact: VERB, with: ADP, the: DET, RDBMS: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, facilitating: VERB, seamless: ADJ, data: NOUN, manipulation: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: The: DET, systematic: ADJ, arrangement: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, in: ADP, tables: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, supported: VERB, by: ADP, keys: NOUN, and: CCONJ, indexes: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, streamlines: VERB, the: DET, organization: NOUN, and: CCONJ, retrieval: NOUN, processes: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: Relationships: NOUN, between: ADP, tables: NOUN, enforce: VERB, data: NOUN, integrity: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, preventing: VERB, inconsistencies: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: Indexing: NOUN, allows: VERB, for: ADP, swift: ADJ, data: NOUN, access: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, particularly: ADV, useful: ADJ, in: ADP, large: ADJ, datasets: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: The: DET, structured: ADJ, query: NOUN, language: NOUN, provides: VERB, a: DET, powerful: ADJ, means: NOUN, of: ADP, interacting: VERB, with: ADP, the: DET, RDBMS: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, offering: VERB, flexibility: NOUN, in: ADP, defining: VERB, operations: NOUN, on: ADP, the: DET, data: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: Collectively: ADV, ,: PUNCT, these: DET, components: NOUN, ensure: VERB, that: SCONJ, an: DET, RDBMS: NOUN, efficiently: ADV, manages: VERB, data: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, providing: VERB, a: DET, reliable: ADJ, and: CCONJ, organized: VERB, framework: NOUN, for: ADP, storing: VERB, and: CCONJ, retrieving: VERB, information: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: The: DET, adherence: NOUN, to: ADP, relational: ADJ, model: NOUN, principles: NOUN, further: ADV, strengthens: VERB, the: DET, system: NOUN, 's: PART, effectiveness: NOUN, in: ADP, handling: VERB, complex: ADJ, datasets: NOUN, and: CCONJ, relationships: NOUN, .: PUNCT
