S1: Continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, is: AUX, a: DET, geological: ADJ, theory: NOUN, suggesting: VERB, that: SCONJ, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, part: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, single: ADJ, supercontinent: NOUN, and: CCONJ, have: AUX, since: SCONJ, drifted: VERB, apart: ADV, over: ADP, geological: ADJ, time: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: This: DET, theory: NOUN, was: AUX, initially: ADV, proposed: VERB, by: ADP, Alfred: PROPN, Wegener: PROPN, in: ADP, the: DET, early: ADJ, 20th: ADJ, century: NOUN, and: CCONJ, laid: VERB, the: DET, groundwork: NOUN, for: ADP, the: DET, development: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, modern: ADJ, plate: NOUN, tectonics: NOUN, theory: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Firstly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, apparent: ADJ, fit: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, coastlines: NOUN, of: ADP, continents: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, particularly: ADV, the: DET, eastern: ADJ, coast: NOUN, of: ADP, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, with: ADP, the: DET, western: ADJ, coast: NOUN, of: ADP, Africa: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, suggests: VERB, a: DET, historical: ADJ, connection: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: This: DET, fit: NOUN, is: AUX, most: ADV, noticeable: ADJ, when: SCONJ, examining: VERB, the: DET, continental: ADJ, shelves: NOUN, rather: ADV, than: ADP, just: ADV, the: DET, coastlines: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Secondly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, fossil: NOUN, evidence: NOUN, plays: VERB, a: DET, crucial: ADJ, role: NOUN, in: ADP, supporting: VERB, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Identical: ADJ, or: CCONJ, closely: ADV, related: VERB, fossils: NOUN, of: ADP, plants: NOUN, and: CCONJ, animals: NOUN, have: AUX, been: AUX, found: VERB, on: ADP, continents: NOUN, now: ADV, separated: VERB, by: ADP, vast: ADJ, oceans: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, indicating: VERB, that: SCONJ, these: DET, landmasses: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, part: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, larger: ADJ, whole: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Furthermore: ADV, ,: PUNCT, geological: ADJ, similarities: NOUN, such: ADJ, as: ADP, matching: VERB, rock: NOUN, formations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, mountain: NOUN, ranges: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, structural: ADJ, features: NOUN, on: ADP, continents: NOUN, separated: VERB, by: ADP, oceans: NOUN, provide: VERB, additional: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, for: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: The: DET, distribution: NOUN, of: ADP, certain: ADJ, geological: ADJ, formations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, like: ADP, the: DET, Appalachian: PROPN, Mountains: PROPN, in: ADP, North: PROPN, America: PROPN, aligning: VERB, with: ADP, the: DET, Caledonian: PROPN, Mountains: PROPN, in: ADP, Scotland: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Scandinavia: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, supports: VERB, the: DET, idea: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, shared: VERB, geological: ADJ, history: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: Additionally: ADV, ,: PUNCT, paleoclimatic: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, like: ADP, the: DET, presence: NOUN, of: ADP, glacial: ADJ, deposits: NOUN, in: ADP, continents: NOUN, like: ADP, India: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Australia: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, which: PRON, are: AUX, now: ADV, located: VERB, closer: ADV, to: ADP, the: DET, equator: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, suggests: VERB, they: PRON, were: AUX, once: ADV, part: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, supercontinent: NOUN, that: PRON, included: VERB, polar: ADJ, regions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
