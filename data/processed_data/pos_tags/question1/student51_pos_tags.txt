S1: Continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, is: AUX, a: DET, geological: ADJ, theory: NOUN, that: PRON, proposes: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, part: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, single: ADJ, supercontinent: NOUN, called: VERB, Pangaea: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, over: ADP, time: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, they: PRON, have: AUX, drifted: VERB, apart: ADV, to: ADP, their: PRON, current: ADJ, positions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: This: DET, theory: NOUN, was: AUX, initially: ADV, proposed: VERB, by: ADP, Alfred: PROPN, Wegener: PROPN, in: ADP, the: DET, early: ADJ, 20th: ADJ, century: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, it: PRON, laid: VERB, the: DET, foundation: NOUN, for: ADP, the: DET, modern: ADJ, theory: NOUN, of: ADP, plate: NOUN, tectonics: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Several: ADJ, lines: NOUN, of: ADP, evidence: NOUN, support: VERB, the: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Firstly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, fit: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, coastlines: NOUN, on: ADP, different: ADJ, continents: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, such: ADJ, as: ADP, the: DET, eastern: ADJ, coast: NOUN, of: ADP, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, fitting: VERB, remarkably: ADV, well: ADV, with: ADP, the: DET, western: ADJ, coast: NOUN, of: ADP, Africa: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, suggests: VERB, a: DET, historical: ADJ, connection: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Secondly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, identical: ADJ, fossils: NOUN, and: CCONJ, rock: NOUN, formations: NOUN, found: VERB, on: ADP, continents: NOUN, that: PRON, are: AUX, now: ADV, separated: VERB, by: ADP, oceans: NOUN, provide: VERB, additional: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: For: ADP, example: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, fossils: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, extinct: ADJ, reptile: NOUN, Mesosaurus: PROPN, are: AUX, found: VERB, in: ADP, both: DET, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Africa: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, indicating: VERB, that: SCONJ, these: DET, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, connected: VERB, .: PUNCT
S7: Furthermore: ADV, ,: PUNCT, geological: ADJ, similarities: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, such: ADJ, as: ADP, matching: VERB, mountain: NOUN, ranges: NOUN, and: CCONJ, rock: NOUN, formations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, on: ADP, continents: NOUN, separated: VERB, by: ADP, vast: ADJ, oceans: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, support: VERB, the: DET, idea: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: The: DET, distribution: NOUN, of: ADP, certain: ADJ, plant: NOUN, and: CCONJ, animal: NOUN, species: NOUN, across: ADP, continents: NOUN, also: ADV, aligns: VERB, with: ADP, the: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, once: ADV, -: PUNCT, connected: VERB, landmass: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: Additionally: ADV, ,: PUNCT, paleoclimatic: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, such: ADJ, as: ADP, glacial: ADJ, deposits: NOUN, and: CCONJ, coal: NOUN, beds: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, supports: VERB, the: DET, theory: NOUN, .: PUNCT
