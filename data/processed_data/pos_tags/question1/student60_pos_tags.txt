S1: Continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, is: AUX, a: DET, geological: ADJ, theory: NOUN, that: PRON, suggests: VERB, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, joined: VERB, together: ADV, in: ADP, a: DET, single: ADJ, supercontinent: NOUN, called: VERB, Pangaea: PROPN, and: CCONJ, have: AUX, since: SCONJ, drifted: VERB, apart: ADV, to: ADP, their: PRON, current: ADJ, positions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: This: DET, concept: NOUN, was: AUX, first: ADV, proposed: VERB, by: ADP, Alfred: PROPN, Wegener: PROPN, in: ADP, the: DET, early: ADJ, 20th: ADJ, century: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: The: DET, coastlines: NOUN, of: ADP, some: DET, continents: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, such: ADJ, as: ADP, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Africa: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, seem: VERB, to: PART, fit: VERB, together: ADV, like: ADP, puzzle: NOUN, pieces: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, suggesting: VERB, a: DET, historical: ADJ, connection: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Matching: VERB, geological: ADJ, features: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, such: ADJ, as: ADP, mountain: NOUN, ranges: NOUN, and: CCONJ, rock: NOUN, formations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, are: AUX, found: VERB, on: ADP, continents: NOUN, that: PRON, are: AUX, now: ADV, separated: VERB, by: ADP, oceans: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, supporting: VERB, the: DET, idea: NOUN, that: SCONJ, they: PRON, were: AUX, once: ADV, part: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, same: ADJ, landmass: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Similar: ADJ, or: CCONJ, identical: ADJ, fossils: NOUN, of: ADP, plants: NOUN, and: CCONJ, animals: NOUN, have: AUX, been: AUX, discovered: VERB, on: ADP, continents: NOUN, that: PRON, are: AUX, currently: ADV, separated: VERB, by: ADP, oceans: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: For: ADP, example: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, fossilized: VERB, remains: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, extinct: ADJ, reptile: NOUN, Mesosaurus: PROPN, are: AUX, found: VERB, in: ADP, both: PRON, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Africa: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S7: Ancient: ADJ, climate: NOUN, indicators: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, such: ADJ, as: ADP, glacial: ADJ, deposits: NOUN, and: CCONJ, coal: NOUN, beds: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, are: AUX, found: VERB, in: ADP, regions: NOUN, where: SCONJ, they: PRON, would: AUX, n't: PART, be: AUX, expected: VERB, based: VERB, on: ADP, current: ADJ, climate: NOUN, conditions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: The: DET, distribution: NOUN, of: ADP, such: ADJ, features: NOUN, makes: VERB, more: ADJ, sense: NOUN, when: SCONJ, considering: VERB, the: DET, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, positioned: VERB, differently: ADV, .: PUNCT
S9: The: DET, current: ADJ, distribution: NOUN, of: ADP, certain: ADJ, plant: NOUN, and: CCONJ, animal: NOUN, species: NOUN, can: AUX, be: AUX, better: ADV, explained: VERB, by: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: For: ADP, instance: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, species: NOUN, that: PRON, are: AUX, now: ADV, separated: VERB, by: ADP, oceans: NOUN, but: CCONJ, have: VERB, similar: ADJ, ancestors: NOUN, may: AUX, have: AUX, evolved: VERB, when: SCONJ, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, closer: ADV, together: ADV, .: PUNCT
