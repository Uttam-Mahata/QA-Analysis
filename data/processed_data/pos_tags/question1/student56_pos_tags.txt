S1: Continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, is: AUX, the: DET, geological: ADJ, theory: NOUN, proposing: VERB, that: SCONJ, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, part: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, single: ADJ, supercontinent: NOUN, and: CCONJ, have: AUX, since: SCONJ, moved: VERB, over: ADP, time: NOUN, to: ADP, their: PRON, current: ADJ, positions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Initially: ADV, proposed: VERB, by: ADP, Darles: PROPN, Charwin: PROPN, in: ADP, 17th: ADJ, century: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, it: PRON, states: VERB, that: SCONJ, formation: NOUN, of: ADP, new: ADJ, landmasses: NOUN, like: ADP, mountain: NOUN, lead: NOUN, to: ADP, it: PRON, .: PUNCT
S3: The: DET, formation: NOUN, of: ADP, mountains: NOUN, is: AUX, a: DET, complex: ADJ, geological: ADJ, process: NOUN, influenced: VERB, by: ADP, various: ADJ, tectonic: ADJ, forces: NOUN, and: CCONJ, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, internal: ADJ, dynamics: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: One: NUM, significant: ADJ, mechanism: NOUN, is: AUX, the: DET, collision: NOUN, of: ADP, tectonic: ADJ, plates: NOUN, at: ADP, convergent: NOUN, boundaries: NOUN, .: PUNCT, Simultaneously: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, compression: NOUN, and: CCONJ, deformation: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, colliding: VERB, plates: NOUN, cause: VERB, uplift: ADJ, and: CCONJ, folding: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, crust: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, forming: VERB, mountain: NOUN, ranges: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: The: DET, Himalayas: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, for: ADP, instance: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, were: AUX, created: VERB, by: ADP, the: DET, collision: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, Indian: ADJ, and: CCONJ, Eurasian: ADJ, plates: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Another: DET, process: NOUN, contributing: VERB, to: ADP, mountain: NOUN, formation: NOUN, is: AUX, the: DET, convergence: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, plates: NOUN, without: ADP, subduction: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Instead: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, colliding: VERB, plates: NOUN, crumple: ADJ, and: CCONJ, compress: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, leading: VERB, to: ADP, the: DET, formation: NOUN, of: ADP, fold: ADJ, mountains: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: The: DET, formation: NOUN, of: ADP, mountains: NOUN, is: AUX, primarily: ADV, driven: VERB, by: ADP, the: DET, collision: NOUN, and: CCONJ, interaction: NOUN, of: ADP, tectonic: ADJ, plates: NOUN, at: ADP, convergent: NOUN, boundaries: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, involving: VERB, processes: NOUN, like: ADP, subduction: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, crustal: NOUN, compression: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, volcanic: ADJ, activity: NOUN, leading: VERB, to: ADP, drift: NOUN, of: ADP, continents: NOUN, .: PUNCT
