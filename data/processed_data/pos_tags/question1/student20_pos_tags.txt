S1: The: DET, theory: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, posits: NOUN, that: SCONJ, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, part: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, supercontinent: NOUN, Pangaea: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, gradually: ADV, drifting: VERB, apart: ADV, and: CCONJ, relocating: VERB, to: ADP, their: PRON, current: ADJ, positions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Supporting: VERB, evidence: NOUN, includes: VERB, the: DET, synchronization: NOUN, of: ADP, coastlines: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, matching: VERB, rock: NOUN, formations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, fossils: NOUN, found: VERB, on: ADP, opposite: ADJ, sides: NOUN, of: ADP, oceans: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: The: DET, fit: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, shelves: NOUN, and: CCONJ, the: DET, alignment: NOUN, of: ADP, mountain: NOUN, ranges: VERB, across: ADP, continents: NOUN, reinforce: VERB, the: DET, notion: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, shared: VERB, geological: ADJ, history: NOUN, .: PUNCT
