S1: The: DET, idea: NOUN, that: SCONJ, continents: NOUN, move: NOUN, was: AUX, n't: PART, entirely: ADV, new: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S2: In: ADP, the: DET, 16th: ADJ, century: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, Abraham: PROPN, Ortelius: PROPN, noticed: VERB, the: DET, uncanny: ADJ, fit: NOUN, of: ADP, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, 's: PART, eastern: ADJ, bulge: PROPN, into: ADP, the: DET, curve: NOUN, of: ADP, Africa: PROPN, 's: PART, western: ADJ, coast: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: But: CCONJ, it: PRON, was: AUX, Alfred: PROPN, Wegener: PROPN, who: PRON, ,: PUNCT, in: ADP, 1912: NUM, ,: PUNCT, presented: VERB, a: DET, compelling: ADJ, case: NOUN, for: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: His: PRON, key: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, was: AUX, like: ADP, finding: VERB, matching: VERB, puzzle: NOUN, pieces: NOUN, on: ADP, different: ADJ, continents: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Fossils: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, same: ADJ, land: NOUN, plants: NOUN, and: CCONJ, animals: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, like: ADP, Mesosaurus: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, were: AUX, found: VERB, in: ADP, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Africa: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, too: ADV, far: ADV, apart: ADV, to: PART, have: AUX, ever: ADV, reached: VERB, each: DET, other: ADJ, by: ADP, swimming: VERB, .: PUNCT
S6: Matching: VERB, rock: NOUN, formations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, like: ADP, the: DET, Appalachians: PROPN, in: ADP, North: PROPN, America: PROPN, and: CCONJ, their: PRON, counterparts: NOUN, in: ADP, Europe: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, hinted: VERB, at: ADP, a: DET, shared: VERB, past: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Wegener: PROPN, also: ADV, proposed: VERB, the: DET, existence: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, supercontinent: NOUN, called: VERB, Pangaea: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, meaning: VERB, ": PUNCT, all: DET, lands: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, ": PUNCT, which: PRON, broke: VERB, apart: ADV, 200: NUM, million: NUM, years: NOUN, ago: ADV, .: PUNCT
S8: The: DET, continents: NOUN, ': PART, coastlines: NOUN, seemed: VERB, to: PART, interlock: VERB, like: ADP, puzzle: NOUN, pieces: NOUN, when: SCONJ, Pangaea: PROPN, was: AUX, reassembled: VERB, on: ADP, a: DET, map: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: However: ADV, ,: PUNCT, Wegener: PROPN, lacked: VERB, a: DET, convincing: ADJ, explanation: NOUN, for: ADP, what: PRON, drove: VERB, this: DET, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: His: PRON, theory: NOUN, faced: VERB, resistance: NOUN, until: ADP, the: DET, 1960s: NOUN, when: SCONJ, the: DET, discovery: NOUN, of: ADP, seafloor: NOUN, spreading: VERB, and: CCONJ, plate: NOUN, tectonics: NOUN, provided: VERB, the: DET, missing: ADJ, piece: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: Plate: ADJ, tectonics: NOUN, revealed: VERB, that: SCONJ, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, surface: NOUN, is: AUX, broken: VERB, into: ADP, giant: ADJ, plates: NOUN, that: PRON, move: VERB, on: ADP, a: DET, conveyor: ADJ, belt: NOUN, of: ADP, molten: ADJ, rock: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: This: DET, movement: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, driven: VERB, by: ADP, forces: NOUN, deep: ADV, within: ADP, the: DET, Earth: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, pushes: NOUN, and: CCONJ, pulls: VERB, the: DET, continents: NOUN, along: ADV, ,: PUNCT, explaining: VERB, their: PRON, drift: NOUN, and: CCONJ, the: DET, formation: NOUN, of: ADP, mountains: NOUN, and: CCONJ, oceans: NOUN, in: ADP, their: PRON, wake: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S13: Continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, though: SCONJ, no: ADV, longer: ADV, called: VERB, that: SCONJ, ,: PUNCT, forms: VERB, the: DET, foundation: NOUN, of: ADP, our: PRON, understanding: NOUN, of: ADP, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, dynamic: ADJ, continents: NOUN, and: CCONJ, the: DET, ever: ADV, -: PUNCT, changing: VERB, puzzle: NOUN, of: ADP, our: PRON, planet: NOUN, .: PUNCT
