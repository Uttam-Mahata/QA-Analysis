S1: Continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, is: AUX, the: DET, geological: ADJ, theory: NOUN, that: PRON, proposes: VERB, the: DET, movement: NOUN, of: ADP, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, continents: NOUN, relative: ADJ, to: ADP, each: DET, other: ADJ, over: ADP, geological: ADJ, time: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: The: DET, theory: NOUN, was: AUX, initially: ADV, suggested: VERB, by: ADP, Alfred: PROPN, Wegener: PROPN, in: ADP, the: DET, early: ADJ, 20th: ADJ, century: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, suggesting: VERB, that: SCONJ, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, part: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, supercontinent: NOUN, called: VERB, Pangaea: PROPN, and: CCONJ, have: AUX, since: SCONJ, drifted: VERB, apart: ADV, .: PUNCT
S3: Although: SCONJ, Wegener: PROPN, 's: PART, initial: ADJ, ideas: NOUN, faced: VERB, skepticism: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, subsequent: ADJ, scientific: ADJ, advancements: NOUN, have: AUX, provided: VERB, substantial: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, supporting: VERB, the: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: One: NUM, significant: ADJ, piece: NOUN, of: ADP, evidence: NOUN, is: AUX, the: DET, fit: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, continents: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, particularly: ADV, the: DET, matching: VERB, coastlines: NOUN, of: ADP, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Africa: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, implying: VERB, they: PRON, were: AUX, once: ADV, connected: VERB, .: PUNCT
S5: Fossil: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, further: ADV, supports: VERB, this: DET, theory: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, as: SCONJ, similar: ADJ, plant: NOUN, and: CCONJ, animal: NOUN, fossils: NOUN, have: AUX, been: AUX, found: VERB, on: ADP, continents: NOUN, that: PRON, are: AUX, now: ADV, separated: VERB, by: ADP, oceans: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Paleoclimatic: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, also: ADV, contributes: VERB, to: ADP, the: DET, theory: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: For: ADP, instance: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, glacial: ADJ, deposits: NOUN, and: CCONJ, striations: NOUN, suggest: VERB, that: SCONJ, continents: NOUN, like: ADP, Africa: PROPN, and: CCONJ, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, were: AUX, once: ADV, located: VERB, closer: ADV, to: ADP, polar: ADJ, regions: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, where: SCONJ, glacial: ADJ, conditions: NOUN, existed: VERB, .: PUNCT
