S1: Explain: VERB, the: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, and: CCONJ, provide: VERB, evidence: NOUN, supporting: VERB, this: DET, theory: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Ans-: CCONJ, 
: SPACE, Imagine: PROPN, Earth: PROPN, as: ADP, a: DET, grand: ADJ, puzzle: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, pieces: NOUN, slowly: ADV, shuffling: VERB, across: ADP, the: DET, table: NOUN, of: ADP, time: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: That: PRON, 's: AUX, the: DET, essence: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, idea: NOUN, that: SCONJ, the: DET, continents: NOUN, we: PRON, know: VERB, are: AUX, n't: PART, fixed: VERB, but: CCONJ, dance: VERB, a: DET, slow: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, geologic: ADJ, waltz: NOUN, throughout: ADP, history: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Think: VERB, of: ADP, it: PRON, like: ADP, a: DET, jigsaw: NOUN, puzzle: NOUN, :: PUNCT, 

: SPACE, Centuries: NOUN, ago: ADV, ,: PUNCT, all: DET, the: DET, continents: NOUN, fit: VERB, together: ADV, snugly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, forming: VERB, a: DET, supercontinent: NOUN, called: VERB, Pangea: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S5: Powerful: ADJ, forces: NOUN, within: ADP, Earth: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, like: ADP, churning: VERB, magma: NOUN, and: CCONJ, shifting: VERB, tectonic: ADJ, plates: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, gradually: ADV, cracked: VERB, Pangea: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, pushing: VERB, its: PRON, pieces: NOUN, apart: ADV, .: PUNCT
S6: These: DET, pieces: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, continents: NOUN, we: PRON, 're: AUX, familiar: ADJ, with: ADP, ,: PUNCT, began: VERB, their: PRON, epic: ADJ, journey: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, drifting: VERB, across: ADP, oceans: NOUN, and: CCONJ, colliding: VERB, into: ADP, mountain: NOUN, ranges: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: But: CCONJ, how: SCONJ, do: AUX, we: PRON, know: VERB, this: PRON, is: AUX, n't: PART, just: ADV, a: DET, wild: ADJ, guess: NOUN, ?: PUNCT
S8: Evidence: NOUN, whispers: VERB, from: ADP, the: DET, rocks: NOUN, and: CCONJ, whispers: NOUN, from: ADP, the: DET, fossils: NOUN, :: PUNCT, 

: SPACE, Matching: VERB, coastlines: NOUN, :: PUNCT, The: DET, jagged: ADJ, edges: NOUN, of: ADP, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Africa: PROPN, seem: VERB, almost: ADV, tailor: NOUN, -: PUNCT, made: VERB, to: PART, fit: VERB, together: ADV, ,: PUNCT, like: SCONJ, puzzle: NOUN, pieces: NOUN, separated: VERB, for: ADP, millions: NOUN, of: ADP, years: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: Fossil: ADJ, friends: NOUN, :: PUNCT, Similar: ADJ, fossils: NOUN, of: ADP, ancient: ADJ, plants: NOUN, and: CCONJ, animals: NOUN, found: VERB, on: ADP, continents: NOUN, now: ADV, separated: VERB, by: ADP, vast: ADJ, oceans: NOUN, suggest: VERB, they: PRON, once: ADV, shared: VERB, a: DET, closer: ADJ, address: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: Rock: PROPN, 's: PART, record: NOUN, :: PUNCT, Matching: VERB, rock: NOUN, formations: NOUN, and: CCONJ, mineral: NOUN, deposits: NOUN, across: ADP, continents: NOUN, tell: VERB, a: DET, tale: NOUN, of: ADP, shared: VERB, geological: ADJ, history: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, hinting: VERB, at: ADP, a: DET, time: NOUN, when: SCONJ, they: PRON, were: AUX, neighbors: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: Continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, may: AUX, not: PART, have: VERB, its: PRON, own: ADJ, theme: NOUN, song: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, its: PRON, evidence: NOUN, sings: VERB, a: DET, compelling: ADJ, tune: NOUN, :: PUNCT, 

: SPACE, The: DET, map: NOUN, of: ADP, Pangea: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, pieced: VERB, together: ADV, from: ADP, these: DET, clues: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, resonates: VERB, with: ADP, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, geological: ADJ, story: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: The: DET, movement: NOUN, of: ADP, continents: NOUN, explains: VERB, the: DET, formation: NOUN, of: ADP, mountain: NOUN, ranges: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, opening: NOUN, and: CCONJ, closing: NOUN, of: ADP, oceans: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, even: ADV, the: DET, distribution: NOUN, of: ADP, climates: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S13: While: SCONJ, the: DET, idea: NOUN, of: ADP, drifting: VERB, continents: NOUN, was: AUX, once: ADV, met: VERB, with: ADP, skepticism: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, weight: NOUN, of: ADP, evidence: NOUN, has: AUX, shifted: VERB, the: DET, tide: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S14: Today: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, is: AUX, not: PART, just: ADV, a: DET, theory: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, a: DET, foundational: ADJ, pillar: NOUN, of: ADP, geology: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, woven: VERB, into: ADP, the: DET, tapestry: NOUN, of: ADP, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, grand: ADJ, history: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S15: So: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, next: ADJ, time: NOUN, you: PRON, glance: VERB, at: ADP, a: DET, map: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, remember: VERB, ,: PUNCT, these: DET, familiar: ADJ, landmasses: NOUN, are: AUX, not: PART, frozen: VERB, in: ADP, time: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S16: They: PRON, 're: AUX, on: ADP, a: DET, slow: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, mesmerizing: VERB, journey: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, forever: ADV, reshaping: VERB, our: PRON, planet: NOUN, 's: PART, story: NOUN, .: PUNCT
