S1: Continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, is: AUX, a: DET, geological: ADJ, theory: NOUN, proposed: VERB, by: ADP, Alfred: PROPN, Wegener: PROPN, in: ADP, the: DET, early: ADJ, 20th: ADJ, century: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, suggesting: VERB, that: SCONJ, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, connected: VERB, as: ADP, a: DET, single: ADJ, landmass: NOUN, called: VERB, Pangaea: PROPN, and: CCONJ, have: AUX, since: SCONJ, drifted: VERB, apart: ADV, over: ADP, millions: NOUN, of: ADP, years: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Wegener: PROPN, 's: PART, theory: NOUN, was: AUX, initially: ADV, met: VERB, with: ADP, skepticism: NOUN, but: CCONJ, laid: VERB, the: DET, foundation: NOUN, for: ADP, the: DET, modern: ADJ, understanding: NOUN, of: ADP, plate: NOUN, tectonics: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Fossil: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, is: AUX, one: NUM, key: ADJ, aspect: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, as: SCONJ, identical: ADJ, fossils: NOUN, of: ADP, plants: NOUN, and: CCONJ, animals: NOUN, have: AUX, been: AUX, found: VERB, on: ADP, continents: NOUN, that: PRON, are: AUX, now: ADV, widely: ADV, separated: VERB, by: ADP, oceans: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: For: ADP, example: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, Mesosaurus: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, a: DET, freshwater: NOUN, reptile: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, is: AUX, found: VERB, in: ADP, both: PRON, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Africa: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S5: This: PRON, suggests: VERB, that: SCONJ, these: DET, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, connected: VERB, .: PUNCT
S6: Geological: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, includes: VERB, the: DET, matching: VERB, rock: NOUN, formations: NOUN, and: CCONJ, mountain: NOUN, ranges: VERB, on: ADP, different: ADJ, continents: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: For: ADP, instance: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, Appalachian: PROPN, Mountains: PROPN, in: ADP, North: PROPN, America: PROPN, align: ADJ, with: ADP, the: DET, Caledonian: PROPN, Mountains: PROPN, in: ADP, Scotland: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Scandinavia: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S8: Paleoclimatic: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, also: ADV, plays: VERB, a: DET, role: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, with: ADP, past: ADJ, climate: NOUN, indicators: NOUN, such: ADJ, as: ADP, glacial: ADJ, deposits: NOUN, and: CCONJ, coal: NOUN, beds: NOUN, showing: VERB, patterns: NOUN, that: PRON, make: VERB, sense: NOUN, when: SCONJ, continents: NOUN, are: AUX, reconstructed: VERB, into: ADP, Pangaea: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S9: Additionally: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, fit: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, continents: NOUN, ': PART, coastlines: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, particularly: ADV, the: DET, east: ADJ, coast: NOUN, of: ADP, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, with: ADP, the: DET, west: PROPN, coast: PROPN, of: ADP, Africa: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, further: ADV, supports: VERB, the: DET, notion: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, .: PUNCT
