: SPACE, The: DET, Jigsaw: PROPN, Fit: PROPN, :: PUNCT, The: DET, uncanny: ADJ, resemblance: NOUN, of: ADP, coastlines: NOUN, across: ADP, continents: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, particularly: ADV, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Africa: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, begged: VERB, the: DET, question: NOUN, –: PUNCT, could: AUX, they: PRON, have: AUX, once: ADV, been: AUX, joined: VERB, ?: PUNCT
S6: It: PRON, 's: AUX, like: ADP, finding: VERB, two: NUM, puzzle: NOUN, pieces: NOUN, with: ADP, perfectly: ADV, matching: ADJ, edges: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Fossil: PROPN, Frenzy: PROPN, :: PUNCT, Discovering: VERB, similar: ADJ, fossils: NOUN, of: ADP, land: NOUN, -: PUNCT, dwelling: VERB, creatures: NOUN, like: ADP, ferns: NOUN, and: CCONJ, Glossopteris: PROPN, trees: NOUN, on: ADP, far: ADV, -: PUNCT, flung: VERB, continents: NOUN, like: ADP, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, Africa: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, India: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, Australia: PROPN, hinted: VERB, at: ADP, a: DET, shared: VERB, past: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, suggesting: VERB, they: PRON, were: AUX, once: ADV, connected: VERB, .: PUNCT

S10: It: PRON, 's: AUX, like: ADP, finding: VERB, identical: ADJ, rock: NOUN, types: NOUN, and: CCONJ, structures: NOUN, on: ADP, opposite: ADJ, sides: NOUN, of: ADP, an: DET, ocean: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, hinting: VERB, at: ADP, a: DET, past: ADJ, togetherness: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: Paleoclimate: PROPN, Puzzles: PROPN, :: PUNCT, Ancient: ADJ, climate: NOUN, patterns: NOUN, painted: VERB, in: ADP, rocks: NOUN, did: AUX, n't: PART, align: VERB, with: ADP, the: DET, current: ADJ, continental: ADJ, positions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: For: ADP, example: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, glacial: ADJ, deposits: NOUN, found: VERB, in: ADP, deserts: NOUN, pointed: VERB, to: ADP, a: DET, time: NOUN, when: SCONJ, those: DET, regions: NOUN, were: AUX, much: ADV, colder: ADJ, and: CCONJ, closer: ADJ, to: ADP, the: DET, pole: NOUN, –: PUNCT, possible: ADJ, only: ADV, if: SCONJ, the: DET, continents: NOUN, had: AUX, drifted: VERB, .: PUNCT
S13: These: DET, diverse: ADJ, pieces: NOUN, of: ADP, evidence: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, like: ADP, scattered: VERB, clues: NOUN, in: ADP, a: DET, detective: NOUN, story: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, led: VERB, Alfred: PROPN, Wegener: PROPN, in: ADP, 1912: NUM, to: PART, propose: VERB, the: DET, idea: NOUN, of: ADP, Pangea: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, a: DET, supercontinent: NOUN, that: PRON, broke: VERB, apart: ADV, 200: NUM, million: NUM, years: NOUN, ago: ADV, ,: PUNCT, setting: VERB, the: DET, continents: NOUN, on: ADP, their: PRON, drifting: VERB, adventure: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S14: While: SCONJ, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, faced: VERB, initial: ADJ, skepticism: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, discovery: NOUN, of: ADP, seafloor: NOUN, spreading: VERB, in: ADP, the: DET, 1960s: NOUN, provided: VERB, the: DET, missing: ADJ, engine: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S15: It: PRON, revealed: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, mantle: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, like: ADP, a: DET, conveyor: NOUN, belt: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, pushes: VERB, tectonic: ADJ, plates: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, carrying: VERB, the: DET, continents: NOUN, on: ADP, their: PRON, back: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, explaining: VERB, their: PRON, movement: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S16: Today: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, has: AUX, evolved: VERB, into: ADP, the: DET, more: ADV, comprehensive: ADJ, theory: NOUN, of: ADP, plate: NOUN, tectonics: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, which: PRON, not: PART, only: ADV, explains: VERB, continental: ADJ, movement: NOUN, but: CCONJ, also: ADV, accounts: VERB, for: ADP, earthquakes: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, volcanoes: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, the: DET, constant: ADJ, reshaping: NOUN, of: ADP, our: PRON, dynamic: ADJ, planet: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S17: So: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, next: ADJ, time: NOUN, you: PRON, look: VERB, at: ADP, a: DET, map: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, remember: VERB, the: DET, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, n't: PART, always: ADV, in: ADP, their: PRON, current: ADJ, positions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S18: They: PRON, 're: AUX, on: ADP, a: DET, grand: ADJ, journey: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, forever: ADV, dancing: VERB, and: CCONJ, reshaping: VERB, our: PRON, planet: NOUN, 's: PART, story: NOUN, .: PUNCT
