S1: Explain: VERB, the: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, and: CCONJ, provide: VERB, evidence: NOUN, supporting: VERB, this: DET, theory: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Ans-: INTJ, 
: SPACE, The: DET, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, hypothesis: NOUN, was: AUX, developed: VERB, in: ADP, the: DET, early: ADJ, part: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, 20th: ADJ, century: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, mostly: ADV, by: ADP, Alfred: PROPN, Wegener: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S3: Wegener: PROPN, said: VERB, that: SCONJ, continents: NOUN, move: VERB, around: ADV, on: ADP, Earth: PROPN, ’s: PART, surface: NOUN, and: CCONJ, that: SCONJ, they: PRON, were: AUX, once: ADV, joined: VERB, together: ADV, as: ADP, a: DET, single: ADJ, supercontinent: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: While: SCONJ, Wegener: PROPN, was: AUX, alive: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, scientists: NOUN, did: AUX, not: PART, believe: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, continents: NOUN, could: AUX, move: VERB, .: PUNCT, Find: VERB, a: DET, map: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, continents: NOUN, and: CCONJ, cut: VERB, each: DET, one: NOUN, out: ADP, .: PUNCT
S5: Better: ADV, yet: ADV, ,: PUNCT, use: VERB, a: DET, map: NOUN, where: SCONJ, the: DET, edges: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, continents: NOUN, show: VERB, the: DET, continental: ADJ, shelf: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: That: PRON, ’s: VERB, the: DET, true: ADJ, size: NOUN, and: CCONJ, shape: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, continent: NOUN, and: CCONJ, many: ADJ, can: AUX, be: AUX, pieced: VERB, together: ADV, like: ADP, a: DET, puzzle: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: The: DET, easiest: ADJ, link: NOUN, is: AUX, between: ADP, the: DET, eastern: ADJ, Americas: PROPN, and: CCONJ, western: ADJ, Africa: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Europe: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, the: DET, rest: NOUN, can: AUX, fit: VERB, together: ADV, too: ADV, .: PUNCT
S8: Alfred: PROPN, Wegener: PROPN, proposed: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, united: VERB, into: ADP, a: DET, single: ADJ, supercontinent: NOUN, named: VERB, Pangaea: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, meaning: VERB, all: DET, earth: NOUN, in: ADP, ancient: ADJ, Greek: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S9: He: PRON, suggested: VERB, that: SCONJ, Pangaea: PROPN, broke: VERB, up: ADP, long: ADV, ago: ADV, and: CCONJ, that: SCONJ, the: DET, continents: NOUN, then: ADV, moved: VERB, to: ADP, their: PRON, current: ADJ, positions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: He: PRON, called: VERB, his: PRON, hypothesis: NOUN, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: Evidence: NOUN, for: ADP, Continental: PROPN, Drift-: PROPN, 
: SPACE, Besides: SCONJ, the: DET, way: NOUN, the: DET, continents: NOUN, fit: VERB, together: ADV, ,: PUNCT, Wegener: PROPN, and: CCONJ, his: PRON, supporters: NOUN, collected: VERB, a: DET, great: ADJ, deal: NOUN, of: ADP, evidence: NOUN, for: ADP, the: DET, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, hypothesis: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: For: ADP, one: NUM, ,: PUNCT, identical: ADJ, rocks: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, same: ADJ, type: NOUN, and: CCONJ, age: NOUN, are: AUX, found: VERB, on: ADP, both: DET, sides: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, Atlantic: PROPN, Ocean: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S13: Wegener: PROPN, said: VERB, the: DET, rocks: NOUN, had: AUX, formed: VERB, side: NOUN, -: PUNCT, by: ADP, -: PUNCT, side: NOUN, and: CCONJ, that: SCONJ, the: DET, land: NOUN, had: AUX, since: SCONJ, moved: VERB, apart: ADV, .: PUNCT, Mountain: NOUN, ranges: VERB, with: ADP, the: DET, same: ADJ, rock: NOUN, types: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, structures: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, ages: NOUN, are: AUX, now: ADV, on: ADP, opposite: ADJ, sides: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, Atlantic: PROPN, Ocean: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S14: The: DET, Appalachians: PROPN, of: ADP, the: DET, eastern: ADJ, United: PROPN, States: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Canada: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, for: ADP, example: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, are: AUX, just: ADV, like: ADP, mountain: NOUN, ranges: NOUN, in: ADP, eastern: ADJ, Greenland: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, Ireland: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, Great: PROPN, Britain: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, Norway: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S15: Wegener: PROPN, concluded: VERB, that: SCONJ, they: PRON, formed: VERB, as: ADP, a: DET, single: ADJ, mountain: NOUN, range: NOUN, that: PRON, was: AUX, separated: VERB, as: SCONJ, the: DET, continents: NOUN, drifted: VERB, .: PUNCT, Ancient: ADJ, fossils: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, same: ADJ, species: NOUN, of: ADP, extinct: ADJ, plants: NOUN, and: CCONJ, animals: NOUN, are: AUX, found: VERB, in: ADP, rocks: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, same: ADJ, age: NOUN, but: CCONJ, are: AUX, on: ADP, continents: NOUN, that: PRON, are: AUX, now: ADV, widely: ADV, separated: VERB, .: PUNCT
S16: Wegener: PROPN, proposed: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, organisms: NOUN, had: AUX, lived: VERB, side: NOUN, by: ADP, side: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, that: SCONJ, the: DET, lands: NOUN, had: AUX, moved: VERB, apart: ADV, after: SCONJ, they: PRON, were: AUX, dead: ADJ, and: CCONJ, fossilized: VERB, .: PUNCT
S17: He: PRON, suggested: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, organisms: NOUN, would: AUX, not: PART, have: AUX, been: AUX, able: ADJ, to: PART, travel: VERB, across: ADP, the: DET, oceans: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S18: For: ADP, example: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, fossils: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, seed: NOUN, fern: NOUN, Glossopteris: PROPN, were: AUX, too: ADV, heavy: ADJ, to: PART, be: AUX, carried: VERB, so: ADV, far: ADV, by: ADP, wind: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S19: The: DET, reptile: NOUN, Mesosaurus: PROPN, could: AUX, only: ADV, swim: VERB, in: ADP, fresh: ADJ, water: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S20: was: AUX, a: DET, swimming: NOUN, reptile: NOUN, but: CCONJ, could: AUX, only: ADV, swim: VERB, in: ADP, fresh: ADJ, water: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S21: Cynognathus: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Lystrosaurus: PROPN, were: AUX, land: NOUN, reptiles: NOUN, and: CCONJ, were: AUX, unable: ADJ, to: PART, swim: VERB, .: PUNCT, Grooves: NOUN, and: CCONJ, rock: NOUN, deposits: NOUN, left: VERB, by: ADP, ancient: ADJ, glaciers: NOUN, are: AUX, found: VERB, today: NOUN, on: ADP, different: ADJ, continents: NOUN, very: ADV, close: ADV, to: ADP, the: DET, equator: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S22: This: PRON, would: AUX, indicate: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, glaciers: NOUN, either: CCONJ, formed: VERB, in: ADP, the: DET, middle: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, ocean: NOUN, and/or: CCONJ, covered: VERB, most: ADJ, of: ADP, the: DET, Earth: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S23: Today: NOUN, glaciers: NOUN, only: ADV, form: NOUN, on: ADP, land: NOUN, and: CCONJ, nearer: VERB, the: DET, poles: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S24: Wegener: PROPN, thought: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, glaciers: NOUN, were: AUX, centered: VERB, over: ADP, the: DET, southern: ADJ, land: NOUN, mass: NOUN, close: ADJ, to: ADP, the: DET, South: PROPN, Pole: PROPN, and: CCONJ, the: DET, continents: NOUN, moved: VERB, to: ADP, their: PRON, present: ADJ, positions: NOUN, later: ADV, on: ADV, .: PUNCT, Coral: ADJ, reefs: NOUN, and: CCONJ, coal: NOUN, -: PUNCT, forming: VERB, swamps: NOUN, are: AUX, found: VERB, in: ADP, tropical: ADJ, and: CCONJ, subtropical: ADJ, environments: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, ancient: ADJ, coal: NOUN, seams: NOUN, and: CCONJ, coral: ADJ, reefs: NOUN, are: AUX, found: VERB, in: ADP, locations: NOUN, where: SCONJ, it: PRON, is: AUX, much: ADV, too: ADV, cold: ADJ, today: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S25: Wegener: PROPN, suggested: VERB, that: SCONJ, these: DET, creatures: NOUN, were: AUX, alive: ADJ, in: ADP, warm: ADJ, climate: NOUN, zones: NOUN, and: CCONJ, that: SCONJ, the: DET, fossils: NOUN, and: CCONJ, coal: NOUN, later: ADV, had: AUX, drifted: VERB, to: ADP, new: ADJ, locations: NOUN, on: ADP, the: DET, continents: NOUN, .: PUNCT, Although: SCONJ, Wegener: PROPN, ’s: PART, evidence: NOUN, was: AUX, sound: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, most: ADJ, geologists: NOUN, at: ADP, the: DET, time: NOUN, rejected: VERB, his: PRON, hypothesis: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S26: Scientists: NOUN, argued: VERB, that: SCONJ, there: PRON, was: VERB, no: DET, way: NOUN, to: PART, explain: VERB, how: SCONJ, solid: ADJ, continents: NOUN, could: AUX, plow: VERB, through: ADP, solid: ADJ, oceanic: ADJ, crust: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S27: Wegener: PROPN, ’s: PART, idea: NOUN, was: AUX, nearly: ADV, forgotten: VERB, until: SCONJ, technological: ADJ, advances: NOUN, presented: VERB, even: ADV, more: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, that: SCONJ, the: DET, continents: NOUN, moved: VERB, and: CCONJ, gave: VERB, scientists: NOUN, the: DET, tools: NOUN, to: PART, develop: VERB, a: DET, mechanism: NOUN, for: ADP, Wegener: PROPN, ’s: PART, drifting: VERB, continents: NOUN, .: PUNCT
