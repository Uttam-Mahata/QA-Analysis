S1: The: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, proposed: VERB, by: ADP, Alfred: PROPN, Wegener: PROPN, in: ADP, the: DET, early: ADJ, 20th: ADJ, century: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, suggests: VERB, that: SCONJ, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, connected: VERB, as: ADP, a: DET, single: ADJ, supercontinent: NOUN, called: VERB, Pangaea: PROPN, and: CCONJ, have: AUX, since: SCONJ, drifted: VERB, apart: ADV, over: ADP, geological: ADJ, time: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Wegener: PROPN, 's: PART, hypothesis: NOUN, was: AUX, based: VERB, on: ADP, several: ADJ, lines: NOUN, of: ADP, evidence: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, although: SCONJ, his: PRON, ideas: NOUN, were: AUX, initially: ADV, met: VERB, with: ADP, skepticism: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, they: PRON, laid: VERB, the: DET, foundation: NOUN, for: ADP, the: DET, modern: ADJ, theory: NOUN, of: ADP, plate: NOUN, tectonics: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: One: NUM, piece: NOUN, of: ADP, evidence: NOUN, supporting: VERB, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, is: AUX, the: DET, fit: NOUN, of: ADP, coastlines: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, where: SCONJ, continents: NOUN, such: ADJ, as: ADP, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Africa: PROPN, appear: VERB, to: PART, fit: VERB, together: ADV, like: ADP, pieces: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, jigsaw: NOUN, puzzle: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Additionally: ADV, ,: PUNCT, identical: ADJ, rock: NOUN, formations: NOUN, and: CCONJ, geological: ADJ, features: NOUN, are: AUX, found: VERB, on: ADP, opposite: ADJ, sides: NOUN, of: ADP, oceans: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, indicating: VERB, a: DET, shared: VERB, history: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Fossil: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, such: ADJ, as: ADP, similar: ADJ, plant: NOUN, and: CCONJ, animal: NOUN, species: NOUN, separated: VERB, by: ADP, vast: ADJ, oceans: NOUN, today: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, supports: VERB, the: DET, idea: NOUN, that: SCONJ, these: DET, organisms: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, part: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, same: ADJ, landmass: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Furthermore: ADV, ,: PUNCT, matching: VERB, geological: ADJ, structures: NOUN, like: ADP, mountain: NOUN, ranges: NOUN, and: CCONJ, ancient: ADJ, climate: NOUN, indicators: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, such: ADJ, as: ADP, glacial: ADJ, deposits: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, provide: VERB, further: ADJ, support: NOUN, for: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: The: DET, discovery: NOUN, of: ADP, mid: ADJ, -: NOUN, ocean: ADJ, ridges: NOUN, and: CCONJ, deep: ADJ, -: PUNCT, sea: NOUN, trenches: NOUN, revealed: VERB, the: DET, dynamic: ADJ, nature: NOUN, of: ADP, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, crust: NOUN, and: CCONJ, the: DET, existence: NOUN, of: ADP, tectonic: ADJ, plates: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: In: ADP, summary: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, is: AUX, supported: VERB, by: ADP, a: DET, convergence: NOUN, of: ADP, evidence: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, including: VERB, the: DET, fit: NOUN, of: ADP, continents: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, matching: VERB, geological: ADJ, features: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, shared: VERB, fossils: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, the: DET, identification: NOUN, of: ADP, tectonic: ADJ, plate: NOUN, boundaries: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: These: DET, factors: NOUN, collectively: ADV, contribute: VERB, to: ADP, our: PRON, understanding: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, ever: ADV, -: PUNCT, changing: VERB, surface: NOUN, and: CCONJ, the: DET, dynamic: ADJ, processes: NOUN, that: PRON, shape: VERB, it: PRON, over: ADP, geological: ADJ, time: NOUN, .: PUNCT
