S1: Explain: VERB, the: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, and: CCONJ, provide: VERB, evidence: NOUN, supporting: VERB, this: DET, theory: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Ans-: X, 
: SPACE, Today: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, most: ADJ, people: NOUN, know: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, landmasses: NOUN, on: ADP, Earth: PROPN, move: VERB, around: ADV, .: PUNCT
S3: But: CCONJ, people: NOUN, have: AUX, n’t: PART, always: ADV, believed: VERB, this: PRON, .: PUNCT
S4: It: PRON, was: AUX, n’t: PART, until: ADP, the: DET, early: ADJ, 20th: ADJ, century: NOUN, that: SCONJ, German: ADJ, scientist: NOUN, Alfred: PROPN, Wegener: PROPN, suggested: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, Earth: PROPN, ’s: PART, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, drifting: VERB, .: PUNCT
S5: He: PRON, called: VERB, this: DET, movement: NOUN, Continental: PROPN, Drift: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S6: He: PRON, was: AUX, not: PART, the: DET, first: ADJ, or: CCONJ, only: ADJ, person: NOUN, to: PART, think: VERB, this: PRON, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, he: PRON, was: AUX, the: DET, first: ADJ, to: PART, talk: VERB, about: ADP, the: DET, idea: NOUN, publicly: ADV, .: PUNCT
S7: Wegener: PROPN, came: VERB, up: ADP, with: ADP, this: DET, idea: NOUN, because: SCONJ, he: PRON, noticed: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, coasts: NOUN, of: ADP, western: ADJ, Africa: PROPN, and: CCONJ, eastern: PROPN, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, looked: VERB, like: ADP, puzzle: NOUN, pieces: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: wondered: VERB, if: SCONJ, they: PRON, might: AUX, have: AUX, once: ADV, fit: VERB, together: ADV, and: CCONJ, then: ADV, drifted: VERB, apart: ADV, .: PUNCT
S9: Looking: VERB, at: ADP, the: DET, continents: NOUN, he: PRON, theorized: VERB, that: SCONJ, they: PRON, had: AUX, once: ADV, been: AUX, joined: VERB, together: ADV, as: ADP, a: DET, supercontinent: NOUN, around: ADP, 225: NUM, million: NUM, years: NOUN, ago: ADV, .: PUNCT
S10: This: DET, continent: NOUN, was: AUX, later: ADV, named: VERB, Pangaea: PROPN, .: PUNCT, People: NOUN, now: ADV, think: VERB, that: SCONJ, other: ADJ, supercontinents: NOUN, may: AUX, also: ADV, have: AUX, existed: VERB, .: PUNCT
S11: These: DET, supercontinents: NOUN, are: AUX, thought: VERB, to: PART, have: AUX, come: VERB, before: ADP, Pangaea: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S12: The: DET, idea: NOUN, of: ADP, moving: VERB, landmasses: NOUN, seems: VERB, obvious: ADJ, now: ADV, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, Wegener: PROPN, ’s: PART, Theory: NOUN, of: ADP, Continental: PROPN, Drift: PROPN, was: AUX, not: PART, accepted: VERB, for: ADP, many: ADJ, years: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S13: Why: SCONJ, ?: PUNCT
S14: Well: INTJ, ,: PUNCT, for: ADP, one: NUM, thing: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, Wegener: PROPN, did: AUX, not: PART, have: VERB, a: DET, convincing: ADJ, explanation: NOUN, for: ADP, the: DET, cause: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, drifting: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S15: First: ADV, ,: PUNCT, he: PRON, suggested: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, moving: VERB, around: ADV, due: ADP, to: ADP, the: DET, Earth: PROPN, ’s: PART, rotation: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S16: This: PRON, later: ADV, turned: VERB, out: ADP, to: PART, be: AUX, wrong: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S17: Secondly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, he: PRON, was: AUX, a: DET, meteorologist: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, not: PART, a: DET, geologist: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S18: This: PRON, meant: VERB, that: SCONJ, geologists: NOUN, did: AUX, n’t: PART, think: VERB, he: PRON, knew: VERB, what: PRON, he: PRON, was: AUX, talking: VERB, about: ADP, and: CCONJ, did: AUX, not: PART, take: VERB, him: PRON, seriously: ADV, .: PUNCT
S19: Fossil: ADJ, Evidence: NOUN, :: PUNCT, One: NUM, type: NOUN, of: ADP, evidence: NOUN, that: PRON, strongly: ADV, supported: VERB, the: DET, Theory: NOUN, of: ADP, Continental: PROPN, Drift: PROPN, is: AUX, the: DET, fossil: NOUN, record: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S20: Scientists: NOUN, have: AUX, found: VERB, fossils: NOUN, of: ADP, similar: ADJ, types: NOUN, of: ADP, plants: NOUN, and: CCONJ, animals: NOUN, in: ADP, rocks: NOUN, of: ADP, similar: ADJ, age: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S21: These: DET, rocks: NOUN, were: AUX, on: ADP, the: DET, shores: NOUN, of: ADP, different: ADJ, continents: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S22: This: PRON, suggests: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, joined: VERB, .: PUNCT
S23: For: ADP, example: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, fossils: NOUN, of: ADP, Mesosaurus: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, a: DET, freshwater: NOUN, reptile: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, have: AUX, been: AUX, found: VERB, both: CCONJ, in: ADP, Brazil: PROPN, and: CCONJ, western: ADJ, Africa: PROPN, .: PUNCT
S24: Also: ADV, ,: PUNCT, fossils: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, land: NOUN, reptile: NOUN, Lystrosaurus: PROPN, have: AUX, been: AUX, found: VERB, in: ADP, Africa: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, India: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Antarctica: PROPN, .: PUNCT
