S1: Explain: VERB, the: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, and: CCONJ, provide: VERB, evidence: NOUN, supporting: VERB, this: DET, theory: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Ans-: INTJ, 
: SPACE, The: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, proposed: VERB, by: ADP, Alfred: PROPN, Wegener: PROPN, in: ADP, the: DET, early: ADJ, 20th: ADJ, century: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, revolutionized: VERB, our: PRON, understanding: NOUN, of: ADP, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, geology: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: This: DET, theory: NOUN, suggests: VERB, that: SCONJ, continents: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, part: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, supercontinent: NOUN, called: VERB, Pangaea: PROPN, and: CCONJ, have: AUX, since: SCONJ, drifted: VERB, apart: ADV, over: ADP, geological: ADJ, time: NOUN, scales: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Wegener: PROPN, supported: VERB, his: PRON, theory: NOUN, with: ADP, compelling: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, from: ADP, different: ADJ, scientific: ADJ, fields: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Firstly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, matching: VERB, coastlines: NOUN, of: ADP, continents: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, particularly: ADV, the: DET, eastern: ADJ, coast: NOUN, of: ADP, South: PROPN, America: PROPN, with: ADP, the: DET, western: ADJ, coast: NOUN, of: ADP, Africa: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, hinted: VERB, at: ADP, a: DET, possible: ADJ, connection: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: The: DET, geometric: ADJ, fit: NOUN, was: AUX, so: ADV, precise: ADJ, that: SCONJ, it: PRON, seemed: VERB, implausible: ADJ, for: SCONJ, it: PRON, to: PART, be: AUX, a: DET, mere: ADJ, coincidence: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Secondly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, identical: ADJ, fossil: NOUN, evidence: NOUN, on: ADP, continents: NOUN, separated: VERB, by: ADP, vast: ADJ, oceans: NOUN, supported: VERB, the: DET, idea: NOUN, of: ADP, past: ADJ, connections: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: Similar: ADJ, fossils: NOUN, of: ADP, plants: NOUN, and: CCONJ, animals: NOUN, found: VERB, on: ADP, continents: NOUN, now: ADV, separated: VERB, by: ADP, oceans: NOUN, suggested: VERB, that: SCONJ, these: DET, regions: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, part: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, same: ADJ, landmass: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: Furthermore: ADV, ,: PUNCT, geological: ADJ, features: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, such: ADJ, as: ADP, mountain: NOUN, ranges: NOUN, and: CCONJ, rock: NOUN, formations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, provided: VERB, additional: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: For: ADP, instance: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, Appalachian: PROPN, Mountains: PROPN, in: ADP, North: PROPN, America: PROPN, seemed: VERB, to: PART, align: VERB, with: ADP, the: DET, Caledonian: PROPN, Mountains: PROPN, in: ADP, Scotland: PROPN, and: CCONJ, Scandinavia: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, reinforcing: VERB, the: DET, notion: NOUN, that: SCONJ, these: DET, regions: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, contiguous: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S11: Paleoclimatic: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, including: VERB, glacial: ADJ, deposits: NOUN, and: CCONJ, evidence: NOUN, of: ADP, past: ADJ, climates: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, also: ADV, bolstered: VERB, the: DET, theory: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: Wegener: PROPN, noted: VERB, that: SCONJ, certain: ADJ, geological: ADJ, formations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, such: ADJ, as: ADP, glacial: ADJ, striations: NOUN, and: CCONJ, tillites: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, were: AUX, found: VERB, in: ADP, regions: NOUN, that: PRON, are: AUX, currently: ADV, widely: ADV, separated: VERB, by: ADP, oceans: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S13: This: PRON, indicated: VERB, that: SCONJ, these: DET, areas: NOUN, were: AUX, once: ADV, positioned: VERB, much: ADV, closer: ADJ, to: ADP, each: DET, other: ADJ, within: ADP, a: DET, single: ADJ, landmass: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S14: Despite: SCONJ, Wegener: PROPN, 's: PART, compelling: ADJ, evidence: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, scientific: ADJ, community: NOUN, initially: ADV, resisted: VERB, the: DET, idea: NOUN, of: ADP, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S15: It: PRON, was: AUX, n't: PART, until: ADP, the: DET, mid-20th: NUM, century: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, with: ADP, the: DET, development: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, theory: NOUN, of: ADP, plate: NOUN, tectonics: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, that: SCONJ, the: DET, concept: NOUN, gained: VERB, widespread: ADJ, acceptance: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S16: Plate: NOUN, tectonics: NOUN, provided: VERB, a: DET, comprehensive: ADJ, framework: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, explaining: VERB, how: SCONJ, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, lithosphere: NOUN, is: AUX, divided: VERB, into: ADP, rigid: ADJ, plates: NOUN, that: PRON, move: VERB, over: ADP, the: DET, semi: ADJ, -: ADJ, fluid: ADJ, asthenosphere: ADV, ,: PUNCT, leading: VERB, to: ADP, the: DET, gradual: ADJ, drifting: NOUN, of: ADP, continents: NOUN, over: ADP, millions: NOUN, of: ADP, years: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S17: In: ADP, essence: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, continental: ADJ, drift: NOUN, revolutionized: VERB, our: PRON, understanding: NOUN, of: ADP, Earth: PROPN, 's: PART, dynamic: ADJ, geological: ADJ, history: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, the: DET, subsequent: ADJ, development: NOUN, of: ADP, plate: NOUN, tectonics: NOUN, provided: VERB, a: DET, unifying: ADJ, theory: NOUN, that: PRON, brought: VERB, together: ADV, diverse: ADJ, geological: ADJ, phenomena: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, offering: VERB, a: DET, comprehensive: ADJ, explanation: NOUN, for: ADP, the: DET, movement: NOUN, of: ADP, continents: NOUN, .: PUNCT
