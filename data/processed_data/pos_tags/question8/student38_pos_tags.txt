S1: How: SCONJ, industrial: ADJ, revolution: NOUN, has: AUX, impacted: VERB, the: DET, modern: ADJ, world: NOUN, ?: PUNCT
S2: Ans-: INTJ, 
: SPACE, The: DET, Industrial: PROPN, Revolution: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, a: DET, major: ADJ, shift: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, late: ADJ, 1700s: NOUN, and: CCONJ, early: ADJ, 1800s: NUM, ,: PUNCT, had: VERB, a: DET, huge: ADJ, impact: NOUN, on: ADP, the: DET, world: NOUN, we: PRON, live: VERB, in: ADP, today: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Imagine: VERB, a: DET, massive: ADJ, transformation: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, like: ADP, going: VERB, from: ADP, horse: NOUN, -: PUNCT, drawn: VERB, carriages: NOUN, to: ADP, spaceships: NOUN, in: ADP, a: DET, few: ADJ, generations: NOUN, !: PUNCT
S4: Here: ADV, 's: AUX, the: DET, gist: NOUN, :: PUNCT, 

: SPACE, *: PUNCT, *: ADJ, Good: ADJ, things: NOUN, :*: PUNCT, *: PUNCT, It: PRON, boosted: VERB, economies: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, making: VERB, things: NOUN, cheaper: ADJ, and: CCONJ, more: ADV, plentiful: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S5: Imagine: VERB, new: ADJ, inventions: NOUN, like: ADP, sewing: NOUN, machines: NOUN, and: CCONJ, steam: NOUN, engines: NOUN, cranking: VERB, out: ADP, clothes: NOUN, and: CCONJ, goods: NOUN, faster: ADV, than: ADP, ever: ADV, before: ADV, .: PUNCT
S6: This: PRON, led: VERB, to: ADP, better: ADJ, living: NOUN, standards: NOUN, for: ADP, many: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, with: ADP, more: ADJ, access: NOUN, to: ADP, food: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, medicine: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, even: ADV, entertainment: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Cities: NOUN, boomed: VERB, ,: PUNCT, offering: VERB, jobs: NOUN, and: CCONJ, opportunities: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: Science: NOUN, and: CCONJ, technology: NOUN, took: VERB, off: ADP, ,: PUNCT, giving: VERB, us: PRON, things: NOUN, like: ADP, vaccines: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, electricity: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, even: ADV, the: DET, internet: NOUN, !: PUNCT
S9: *: PUNCT, *: PUNCT, Not: PART, -: PUNCT, so: ADV, -: PUNCT, good: ADJ, things: NOUN, :*: PUNCT, *: PUNCT, The: DET, flip: ADJ, side: NOUN, ?: PUNCT
S10: Inequality: PROPN, grew: VERB, ,: PUNCT, with: ADP, rich: ADJ, factory: NOUN, owners: NOUN, getting: VERB, richer: ADJ, while: SCONJ, workers: NOUN, often: ADV, faced: VERB, tough: ADJ, conditions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: Pollution: NOUN, and: CCONJ, environmental: ADJ, damage: NOUN, ramped: VERB, up: ADP, .: PUNCT
S12: Cities: NOUN, could: AUX, get: VERB, overcrowded: ADJ, and: CCONJ, unhealthy: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S13: Plus: CCONJ, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, whole: ADJ, system: NOUN, relied: VERB, on: ADP, burning: VERB, fossil: NOUN, fuels: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, which: PRON, has: VERB, consequences: NOUN, we: PRON, 're: AUX, still: ADV, dealing: VERB, with: ADP, today: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S14: So: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, Industrial: PROPN, Revolution: PROPN, was: AUX, a: DET, mixed: ADJ, bag: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S15: It: PRON, brought: VERB, kemajuan: NOUN, but: CCONJ, also: ADV, challenges: VERB, .: PUNCT
S16: We: PRON, 're: AUX, still: ADV, figuring: VERB, out: ADP, how: SCONJ, to: PART, balance: VERB, its: PRON, benefits: NOUN, with: ADP, its: PRON, downsides: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, like: ADP, making: VERB, sure: ADJ, everyone: PRON, shares: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, kemajuan: NOUN, and: CCONJ, protecting: VERB, the: DET, planet: NOUN, for: ADP, future: ADJ, generations: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S17: Remember: VERB, ,: PUNCT, history: NOUN, is: AUX, complex: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, there: PRON, 's: VERB, always: ADV, more: ADJ, to: PART, learn: VERB, !: PUNCT
S18: If: SCONJ, you: PRON, 're: AUX, curious: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, keep: VERB, exploring: VERB, and: CCONJ, asking: VERB, questions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
