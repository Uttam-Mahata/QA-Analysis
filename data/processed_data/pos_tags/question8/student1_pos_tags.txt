S4: The: DET, Industrial: PROPN, Revolution: PROPN, also: ADV, had: VERB, profound: ADJ, social: ADJ, implications: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, as: SCONJ, it: PRON, spurred: VERB, urbanization: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, drawing: VERB, people: NOUN, from: ADP, rural: ADJ, areas: NOUN, to: ADP, cities: NOUN, in: ADP, search: NOUN, of: ADP, employment: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: This: DET, urban: ADJ, migration: NOUN, led: VERB, to: ADP, the: DET, formation: NOUN, of: ADP, large: ADJ, industrial: ADJ, centers: NOUN, and: CCONJ, the: DET, rise: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, new: ADJ, working: VERB, class: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Additionally: ADV, ,: PUNCT, it: PRON, brought: VERB, about: ADP, changes: NOUN, in: ADP, societal: ADJ, structures: NOUN, and: CCONJ, values: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, paving: VERB, the: DET, way: NOUN, for: ADP, the: DET, development: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, more: ADV, complex: ADJ, and: CCONJ, interconnected: VERB, global: ADJ, society: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Economically: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, Industrial: PROPN, Revolution: PROPN, stimulated: VERB, economic: ADJ, growth: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, fostering: VERB, the: DET, creation: NOUN, of: ADP, wealth: NOUN, and: CCONJ, the: DET, expansion: NOUN, of: ADP, trade: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: It: PRON, laid: VERB, the: DET, groundwork: NOUN, for: ADP, capitalism: NOUN, as: ADP, a: DET, dominant: ADJ, economic: ADJ, system: NOUN, and: CCONJ, contributed: VERB, to: ADP, the: DET, rise: NOUN, of: ADP, industrialized: ADJ, nations: NOUN, as: ADP, global: ADJ, economic: ADJ, powers: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: Technological: ADJ, advancements: NOUN, from: ADP, the: DET, Industrial: PROPN, Revolution: PROPN, extended: VERB, beyond: ADP, manufacturing: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, influencing: VERB, transportation: NOUN, with: ADP, the: DET, development: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, locomotive: ADJ, and: CCONJ, steamship: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: This: DET, innovation: NOUN, facilitated: VERB, the: DET, movement: NOUN, of: ADP, goods: NOUN, and: CCONJ, people: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, further: ADV, connecting: VERB, distant: ADJ, regions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: The: DET, Industrial: PROPN, Revolution: PROPN, also: ADV, had: VERB, environmental: ADJ, consequences: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, with: ADP, increased: VERB, industrial: ADJ, activity: NOUN, leading: VERB, to: ADP, pollution: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, deforestation: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, other: ADJ, ecological: ADJ, challenges: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: This: PRON, marks: VERB, a: DET, key: ADJ, turning: NOUN, point: NOUN, in: ADP, humanity: NOUN, 's: PART, impact: NOUN, on: ADP, the: DET, environment: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S13: Socially: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, Industrial: PROPN, Revolution: PROPN, sparked: VERB, movements: NOUN, for: ADP, workers: NOUN, ': PART, rights: NOUN, and: CCONJ, labor: NOUN, reforms: NOUN, as: SCONJ, the: DET, conditions: NOUN, in: ADP, factories: NOUN, prompted: VERB, concerns: NOUN, about: ADP, worker: NOUN, welfare: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S14: These: DET, movements: NOUN, laid: VERB, the: DET, foundation: NOUN, for: ADP, modern: ADJ, labor: NOUN, laws: NOUN, and: CCONJ, the: DET, concept: NOUN, of: ADP, workers: NOUN, ': PART, rights: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S15: In: ADP, conclusion: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, Industrial: PROPN, Revolution: PROPN, has: AUX, left: VERB, an: DET, indelible: ADJ, mark: NOUN, on: ADP, the: DET, modern: ADJ, world: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, shaping: VERB, economic: ADJ, systems: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, technological: ADJ, landscapes: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, societal: ADJ, structures: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, environmental: ADJ, dynamics: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S16: Its: PRON, impacts: NOUN, continue: VERB, to: PART, resonate: VERB, in: ADP, the: DET, 21st: ADJ, century: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, influencing: VERB, the: DET, way: NOUN, we: PRON, live: VERB, ,: PUNCT, work: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, interact: VERB, on: ADP, a: DET, global: ADJ, scale: NOUN, .: PUNCT
