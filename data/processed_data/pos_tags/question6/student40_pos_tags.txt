S1: What: PRON, are: AUX, the: DET, fundamental: ADJ, principles: NOUN, of: ADP, machine: NOUN, learning: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, how: SCONJ, do: AUX, they: PRON, contribute: VERB, to: ADP, the: DET, development: NOUN, of: ADP, intelligent: ADJ, systems: NOUN, ?: PUNCT
S2: Ans-: CCONJ, 
: SPACE, Machine: PROPN, learning: NOUN, is: AUX, like: ADP, teaching: VERB, a: DET, computer: NOUN, to: PART, learn: VERB, on: ADP, its: PRON, own: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S3: It: PRON, works: VERB, by: ADP, feeding: VERB, it: PRON, massive: ADJ, amounts: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, like: ADP, pictures: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, text: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, or: CCONJ, numbers: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Then: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, computer: NOUN, sifts: VERB, through: ADP, this: DET, data: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, searching: VERB, for: ADP, patterns: NOUN, and: CCONJ, connections: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Think: VERB, of: ADP, it: PRON, like: ADP, finding: VERB, themes: NOUN, in: ADP, a: DET, huge: ADJ, library: NOUN, of: ADP, books: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: When: SCONJ, it: PRON, finds: VERB, a: DET, pattern: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, it: PRON, builds: VERB, a: DET, kind: NOUN, of: ADP, mental: ADJ, map: NOUN, of: ADP, it: PRON, ,: PUNCT, remembering: VERB, how: SCONJ, things: NOUN, are: AUX, related: VERB, .: PUNCT
S7: Over: ADP, time: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, with: ADP, more: ADJ, data: NOUN, and: CCONJ, feedback: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, these: DET, maps: NOUN, become: VERB, more: ADV, detailed: ADJ, and: CCONJ, accurate: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S8: This: PRON, lets: VERB, the: DET, computer: NOUN, make: VERB, predictions: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, like: ADP, suggesting: VERB, what: PRON, you: PRON, might: AUX, like: VERB, to: PART, watch: VERB, next: ADV, or: CCONJ, helping: VERB, doctors: NOUN, diagnose: NOUN, diseases: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: These: DET, skills: NOUN, are: AUX, the: DET, building: NOUN, blocks: NOUN, of: ADP, intelligent: ADJ, systems: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, enabling: VERB, them: PRON, to: ADP, automate: ADJ, tasks: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, personalize: VERB, experiences: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, even: ADV, optimize: NOUN, processes: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: It: PRON, 's: AUX, like: ADP, having: VERB, a: DET, super: ADJ, -: ADJ, smart: ADJ, assistant: NOUN, that: PRON, keeps: VERB, getting: VERB, better: ADJ, as: SCONJ, you: PRON, work: VERB, with: ADP, it: PRON, !: PUNCT
S11: And: CCONJ, just: ADV, like: ADP, any: DET, powerful: ADJ, tool: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, it: PRON, 's: AUX, important: ADJ, to: PART, use: VERB, machine: NOUN, learning: VERB, responsibly: ADV, and: CCONJ, ethically: ADV, .: PUNCT
S12: But: CCONJ, its: PRON, potential: NOUN, to: PART, improve: VERB, our: PRON, lives: NOUN, in: ADP, countless: ADJ, ways: NOUN, is: AUX, truly: ADV, exciting: ADJ, .: PUNCT
