S1: Machine: NOUN, learning: NOUN, (: PUNCT, ML: PROPN, ): PUNCT, is: AUX, a: DET, subset: NOUN, of: ADP, artificial: ADJ, intelligence: NOUN, (: PUNCT, AI: PROPN, ): PUNCT, that: PRON, focuses: VERB, on: ADP, the: DET, development: NOUN, of: ADP, algorithms: NOUN, and: CCONJ, statistical: ADJ, models: NOUN, that: PRON, enable: VERB, computers: NOUN, to: PART, perform: VERB, tasks: NOUN, without: ADP, explicit: ADJ, programming: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Firstly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, principle: NOUN, of: ADP, supervised: ADJ, learning: NOUN, involves: VERB, training: VERB, a: DET, model: NOUN, on: ADP, a: DET, labeled: VERB, dataset: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, where: SCONJ, the: DET, algorithm: PROPN, learns: VERB, to: PART, map: VERB, input: NOUN, data: NOUN, to: ADP, corresponding: VERB, output: NOUN, labels: NOUN, .: PUNCT, Another: DET, key: ADJ, principle: NOUN, is: AUX, unsupervised: VERB, learning: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, which: PRON, deals: VERB, with: ADP, unlabeled: ADJ, data: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, seeking: VERB, to: PART, discover: VERB, inherent: ADJ, patterns: NOUN, or: CCONJ, relationships: NOUN, within: ADP, the: DET, dataset: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: The: DET, principle: NOUN, of: ADP, generalization: NOUN, is: AUX, crucial: ADJ, for: ADP, ensuring: VERB, that: SCONJ, machine: NOUN, learning: NOUN, models: NOUN, perform: VERB, well: ADV, on: ADP, unseen: ADJ, data: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Models: NOUN, should: AUX, not: PART, just: ADV, memorize: VERB, the: DET, training: NOUN, data: NOUN, but: CCONJ, should: AUX, instead: ADV, generalize: VERB, patterns: NOUN, to: PART, make: VERB, accurate: ADJ, predictions: NOUN, on: ADP, new: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, unseen: ADJ, instances: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Generalization: NOUN, is: AUX, essential: ADJ, for: ADP, creating: VERB, intelligent: ADJ, systems: NOUN, that: PRON, can: AUX, adapt: VERB, and: CCONJ, perform: VERB, reliably: ADV, in: ADP, diverse: ADJ, real: ADJ, -: PUNCT, world: NOUN, scenarios: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Bias: NOUN, and: CCONJ, fairness: NOUN, are: AUX, critical: ADJ, considerations: NOUN, in: ADP, machine: NOUN, learning: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, emphasizing: VERB, the: DET, need: NOUN, to: PART, ensure: VERB, that: SCONJ, models: NOUN, do: AUX, not: PART, perpetuate: VERB, or: CCONJ, amplify: VERB, existing: VERB, biases: NOUN, in: ADP, the: DET, data: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Addressing: VERB, bias: NOUN, contributes: VERB, to: ADP, the: DET, development: NOUN, of: ADP, intelligent: ADJ, systems: NOUN, that: PRON, make: VERB, fair: ADJ, and: CCONJ, ethical: ADJ, decisions: NOUN, across: ADP, diverse: ADJ, populations: NOUN, .: PUNCT
