S1: Machine: NOUN, learning: NOUN, is: AUX, a: DET, subfield: NOUN, of: ADP, artificial: ADJ, intelligence: NOUN, that: PRON, gives: VERB, computers: NOUN, the: DET, ability: NOUN, to: PART, learn: VERB, without: ADP, being: AUX, explicitly: ADV, programmed: VERB, .: PUNCT
S2: It: PRON, is: AUX, based: VERB, on: ADP, the: DET, idea: NOUN, that: SCONJ, machines: NOUN, can: AUX, learn: VERB, from: ADP, data: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, identify: VERB, patterns: NOUN, and: CCONJ, make: VERB, decisions: NOUN, with: ADP, minimal: ADJ, human: ADJ, intervention: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: The: DET, fundamental: ADJ, principles: NOUN, of: ADP, machine: NOUN, learning: NOUN, include: VERB, supervised: ADJ, learning: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, unsupervised: ADJ, learning: PROPN, ,: PUNCT, semi: ADJ, -: ADJ, supervised: ADJ, learning: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, reinforcement: NOUN, learning: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: These: DET, principles: NOUN, are: AUX, used: VERB, to: PART, develop: VERB, intelligent: ADJ, systems: NOUN, that: PRON, can: AUX, perform: VERB, complex: ADJ, tasks: NOUN, in: ADP, a: DET, way: NOUN, that: PRON, is: AUX, similar: ADJ, to: ADP, how: SCONJ, humans: NOUN, solve: VERB, problems: NOUN, .: PUNCT
