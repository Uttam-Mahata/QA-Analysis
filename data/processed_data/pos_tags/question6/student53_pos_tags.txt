S1: Machine: NOUN, learning: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, driving: VERB, force: NOUN, behind: ADP, many: ADJ, modern: ADJ, intelligent: ADJ, systems: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, rests: VERB, on: ADP, a: DET, few: ADJ, key: ADJ, principles: NOUN, that: PRON, allow: VERB, computers: NOUN, to: PART, learn: VERB, and: CCONJ, grow: VERB, .: PUNCT
S2: Machine: NOUN, learning: VERB, algorithms: NOUN, constantly: ADV, strive: VERB, to: PART, improve: VERB, their: PRON, performance: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: They: PRON, use: VERB, mathematical: ADJ, techniques: NOUN, to: PART, adjust: VERB, their: PRON, internal: ADJ, parameters: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, optimizing: VERB, their: PRON, ability: NOUN, to: PART, learn: VERB, from: ADP, the: DET, data: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: This: DET, ongoing: ADJ, optimization: NOUN, process: NOUN, ensures: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, models: NOUN, become: VERB, increasingly: ADV, accurate: ADJ, and: CCONJ, efficient: ADJ, over: ADP, time: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Measuring: VERB, the: DET, performance: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, machine: NOUN, learning: NOUN, model: NOUN, is: AUX, crucial: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S6: By: ADP, evaluating: VERB, how: SCONJ, well: ADV, the: DET, model: NOUN, performs: VERB, on: ADP, unseen: ADJ, data: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, we: PRON, can: AUX, assess: VERB, its: PRON, effectiveness: NOUN, and: CCONJ, identify: VERB, areas: NOUN, for: ADP, improvement: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: This: DET, feedback: NOUN, loop: NOUN, is: AUX, essential: ADJ, for: ADP, guiding: VERB, the: DET, optimization: NOUN, process: NOUN, and: CCONJ, ensuring: VERB, the: DET, model: NOUN, 's: PART, real: ADJ, -: PUNCT, world: NOUN, usefulness: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: Machine: NOUN, learning: NOUN, is: AUX, an: DET, iterative: ADJ, process: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: Based: VERB, on: ADP, the: DET, evaluation: NOUN, results: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, model: NOUN, is: AUX, refined: VERB, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, the: DET, learning: NOUN, process: NOUN, starts: VERB, anew: ADV, with: ADP, the: DET, improved: ADJ, model: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: This: DET, cycle: NOUN, of: ADP, training: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, evaluation: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, refinement: NOUN, continues: VERB, until: SCONJ, the: DET, desired: VERB, level: NOUN, of: ADP, accuracy: NOUN, and: CCONJ, performance: NOUN, is: AUX, achieved: VERB, .: PUNCT
