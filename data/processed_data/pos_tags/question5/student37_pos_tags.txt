S1: Discuss: VERB, the: DET, significance: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, in: ADP, extracting: VERB, valuable: ADJ, insights: NOUN, from: ADP, large: ADJ, datasets: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: Provide: VERB, an: DET, example: NOUN, of: ADP, a: DET, real: ADJ, -: PUNCT, world: NOUN, application: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Ans-: CCONJ, 
: SPACE, Data: PROPN, science: NOUN, is: AUX, of: ADP, great: ADJ, significance: NOUN, in: ADP, extracting: VERB, valuable: ADJ, insights: NOUN, from: ADP, large: ADJ, datasets: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: It: PRON, involves: VERB, the: DET, use: NOUN, of: ADP, various: ADJ, techniques: NOUN, such: ADJ, as: ADP, machine: NOUN, learning: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, data: NOUN, mining: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, statistical: ADJ, modeling: NOUN, to: PART, analyze: VERB, complex: ADJ, data: NOUN, and: CCONJ, extract: VERB, meaningful: ADJ, patterns: NOUN, and: CCONJ, trends: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: One: NUM, real: ADJ, -: PUNCT, world: NOUN, application: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, is: AUX, in: ADP, the: DET, field: NOUN, of: ADP, predictive: ADJ, analytics: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, where: SCONJ, organizations: NOUN, use: VERB, historical: ADJ, and: CCONJ, real: ADJ, -: PUNCT, time: NOUN, data: NOUN, to: PART, make: VERB, predictions: NOUN, about: ADP, future: ADJ, events: NOUN, or: CCONJ, behaviors: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: For: ADP, instance: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, in: ADP, the: DET, financial: ADJ, sector: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, is: AUX, used: VERB, to: PART, detect: VERB, fraudulent: ADJ, transactions: NOUN, by: ADP, analyzing: VERB, patterns: NOUN, in: ADP, large: ADJ, volumes: NOUN, of: ADP, transaction: NOUN, data: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: This: PRON, not: PART, only: ADV, helps: VERB, in: ADP, minimizing: VERB, financial: ADJ, losses: NOUN, but: CCONJ, also: ADV, enhances: VERB, security: NOUN, measures: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: Therefore: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, application: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, enables: VERB, organizations: NOUN, to: PART, make: VERB, informed: ADJ, decisions: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, improve: VERB, operational: ADJ, efficiency: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, gain: VERB, a: DET, competitive: ADJ, advantage: NOUN, in: ADP, today: NOUN, 's: PART, data: NOUN, -: PUNCT, driven: VERB, world: NOUN, .: PUNCT
