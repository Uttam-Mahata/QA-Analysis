S1: Data: NOUN, science: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, although: SCONJ, widely: ADV, acknowledged: VERB, for: ADP, its: PRON, transformative: ADJ, potential: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, faces: VERB, challenges: NOUN, in: ADP, realizing: VERB, its: PRON, promises: NOUN, of: ADP, extracting: VERB, valuable: ADJ, insights: NOUN, from: ADP, large: ADJ, datasets: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: One: NUM, critical: ADJ, concern: NOUN, is: AUX, the: DET, potential: NOUN, for: ADP, bias: NOUN, in: ADP, data: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, which: PRON, can: AUX, lead: VERB, to: ADP, skewed: ADJ, results: NOUN, and: CCONJ, discriminatory: ADJ, outcomes: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: If: SCONJ, historical: ADJ, data: NOUN, used: VERB, for: ADP, training: NOUN, models: NOUN, contains: VERB, biases: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, algorithms: NOUN, may: AUX, perpetuate: VERB, and: CCONJ, exacerbate: VERB, existing: VERB, inequalities: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: Another: DET, challenge: NOUN, lies: VERB, in: ADP, the: DET, ethical: ADJ, use: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, especially: ADV, regarding: VERB, privacy: NOUN, concerns: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: As: SCONJ, organizations: NOUN, collect: VERB, and: CCONJ, analyze: VERB, vast: ADJ, amounts: NOUN, of: ADP, personal: ADJ, information: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, there: PRON, is: VERB, a: DET, risk: NOUN, of: ADP, infringing: VERB, on: ADP, individuals: NOUN, ': PART, privacy: NOUN, rights: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Striking: VERB, a: DET, balance: NOUN, between: ADP, extracting: VERB, meaningful: ADJ, insights: NOUN, and: CCONJ, respecting: VERB, privacy: NOUN, regulations: NOUN, is: AUX, an: DET, ongoing: ADJ, challenge: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: The: DET, interpretability: NOUN, of: ADP, complex: ADJ, machine: NOUN, learning: NOUN, models: NOUN, is: AUX, also: ADV, a: DET, hurdle: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: As: SCONJ, algorithms: NOUN, become: VERB, more: ADV, sophisticated: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, understanding: VERB, how: SCONJ, they: PRON, arrive: VERB, at: ADP, specific: ADJ, conclusions: NOUN, can: AUX, be: AUX, challenging: VERB, .: PUNCT
S9: This: DET, lack: NOUN, of: ADP, transparency: NOUN, can: AUX, lead: VERB, to: ADP, skepticism: NOUN, and: CCONJ, hinder: VERB, the: DET, acceptance: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, -: PUNCT, driven: VERB, insights: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: Moreover: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, dynamic: ADJ, nature: NOUN, of: ADP, datasets: NOUN, and: CCONJ, evolving: VERB, technology: NOUN, can: AUX, make: VERB, it: PRON, difficult: ADJ, for: SCONJ, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, practices: NOUN, to: PART, keep: VERB, pace: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S11: Outdated: ADJ, methodologies: NOUN, or: CCONJ, tools: NOUN, may: AUX, result: VERB, in: ADP, less: ADV, accurate: ADJ, predictions: NOUN, and: CCONJ, hinder: VERB, the: DET, adaptability: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, to: ADP, changing: VERB, contexts: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S12: In: ADP, conclusion: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, while: SCONJ, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, holds: VERB, immense: ADJ, promise: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, acknowledging: VERB, and: CCONJ, addressing: VERB, these: DET, challenges: NOUN, is: AUX, crucial: ADJ, for: ADP, fostering: VERB, trust: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, ensuring: VERB, ethical: ADJ, practices: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, maximizing: VERB, the: DET, value: NOUN, of: ADP, insights: NOUN, derived: VERB, from: ADP, large: ADJ, datasets: NOUN, .: PUNCT
