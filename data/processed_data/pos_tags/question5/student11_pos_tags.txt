S1: Data: NOUN, science: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, often: ADV, hailed: VERB, as: ADP, a: DET, revolutionary: ADJ, field: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, may: AUX, not: PART, always: ADV, live: VERB, up: ADP, to: ADP, the: DET, hype: NOUN, in: ADP, extracting: VERB, valuable: ADJ, insights: NOUN, from: ADP, large: ADJ, datasets: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: The: DET, complexity: NOUN, of: ADP, algorithms: NOUN, and: CCONJ, the: DET, need: NOUN, for: ADP, specialized: ADJ, skills: NOUN, can: AUX, make: VERB, implementation: NOUN, challenging: ADJ, and: CCONJ, expensive: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, deterring: VERB, some: DET, organizations: NOUN, from: ADP, embracing: VERB, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, fully: ADV, .: PUNCT
S3: Moreover: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, outcomes: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, analyses: NOUN, may: AUX, not: PART, always: ADV, be: AUX, actionable: ADJ, or: CCONJ, relevant: ADJ, to: ADP, real: ADJ, -: PUNCT, world: NOUN, decision: NOUN, -: PUNCT, making: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: The: DET, predictive: ADJ, power: NOUN, of: ADP, models: NOUN, can: AUX, be: AUX, limited: VERB, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, the: DET, insights: NOUN, derived: VERB, may: AUX, not: PART, provide: VERB, a: DET, clear: ADJ, path: NOUN, for: SCONJ, organizations: NOUN, to: PART, improve: VERB, their: PRON, operations: NOUN, or: CCONJ, strategies: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: In: ADP, some: DET, cases: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, volume: NOUN, and: CCONJ, variety: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, may: AUX, lead: VERB, to: ADP, information: NOUN, overload: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, making: VERB, it: PRON, difficult: ADJ, for: SCONJ, organizations: NOUN, to: PART, prioritize: VERB, and: CCONJ, focus: VERB, on: ADP, the: DET, most: ADV, critical: ADJ, insights: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: This: PRON, can: AUX, result: VERB, in: ADP, a: DET, situation: NOUN, where: SCONJ, the: DET, sheer: ADJ, quantity: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, becomes: VERB, a: DET, hindrance: NOUN, rather: ADV, than: ADP, an: DET, asset: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Furthermore: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, field: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, is: AUX, constantly: ADV, evolving: VERB, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, keeping: VERB, up: ADP, with: ADP, the: DET, latest: ADJ, techniques: NOUN, and: CCONJ, technologies: NOUN, can: AUX, be: AUX, a: DET, daunting: ADJ, task: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: Organizations: NOUN, may: AUX, find: VERB, it: PRON, challenging: VERB, to: PART, stay: VERB, abreast: ADV, of: ADP, developments: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, potentially: ADV, rendering: VERB, their: PRON, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, efforts: NOUN, outdated: VERB, or: CCONJ, less: ADV, effective: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S9: While: SCONJ, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, holds: VERB, promise: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, it: PRON, is: AUX, essential: ADJ, to: PART, recognize: VERB, that: SCONJ, its: PRON, implementation: NOUN, comes: VERB, with: ADP, hurdles: NOUN, and: CCONJ, uncertainties: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, its: PRON, impact: NOUN, may: AUX, not: PART, always: ADV, align: VERB, with: ADP, the: DET, lofty: ADJ, expectations: NOUN, set: VERB, for: ADP, the: DET, field: NOUN, .: PUNCT
