S1: Data: NOUN, science: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, though: SCONJ, often: ADV, praised: VERB, for: ADP, its: PRON, transformative: ADJ, potential: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, can: AUX, sometimes: ADV, fall: VERB, short: ADJ, in: ADP, delivering: VERB, actionable: ADJ, insights: NOUN, from: ADP, large: ADJ, datasets: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: One: NUM, challenge: NOUN, lies: VERB, in: ADP, the: DET, interpretability: NOUN, of: ADP, complex: ADJ, machine: NOUN, learning: NOUN, models: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, as: SCONJ, their: PRON, predictions: NOUN, may: AUX, lack: VERB, transparency: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, making: VERB, it: PRON, difficult: ADJ, for: SCONJ, stakeholders: NOUN, to: PART, trust: VERB, and: CCONJ, act: VERB, upon: SCONJ, the: DET, generated: VERB, insights: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: In: ADP, addition: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, time: NOUN, and: CCONJ, resources: NOUN, required: VERB, for: ADP, implementing: VERB, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, initiatives: NOUN, can: AUX, be: AUX, substantial: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S4: Organizations: NOUN, may: AUX, find: VERB, it: PRON, challenging: VERB, to: PART, justify: VERB, the: DET, investment: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, especially: ADV, when: SCONJ, the: DET, return: NOUN, on: ADP, investment: NOUN, is: AUX, not: PART, immediately: ADV, apparent: ADJ, or: CCONJ, guaranteed: VERB, .: PUNCT
S5: Furthermore: ADV, ,: PUNCT, ethical: ADJ, considerations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, such: ADJ, as: ADP, data: NOUN, privacy: NOUN, and: CCONJ, bias: NOUN, in: ADP, algorithms: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, can: AUX, pose: VERB, significant: ADJ, hurdles: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Biased: ADJ, datasets: NOUN, can: AUX, perpetuate: VERB, and: CCONJ, even: ADV, exacerbate: ADJ, existing: VERB, inequalities: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, leading: VERB, to: ADP, unfair: ADJ, or: CCONJ, inaccurate: ADJ, outcomes: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Despite: SCONJ, these: DET, challenges: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, potential: ADJ, benefits: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, are: AUX, considerable: ADJ, .: PUNCT
S8: When: SCONJ, applied: VERB, correctly: ADV, ,: PUNCT, it: PRON, can: AUX, uncover: VERB, patterns: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, correlations: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, trends: NOUN, that: SCONJ, traditional: ADJ, methods: NOUN, may: AUX, miss: VERB, .: PUNCT
S9: Striking: VERB, the: DET, right: ADJ, balance: NOUN, between: ADP, the: DET, complexity: NOUN, of: ADP, models: NOUN, and: CCONJ, their: PRON, interpretability: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, addressing: VERB, ethical: ADJ, concerns: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, and: CCONJ, demonstrating: VERB, tangible: ADJ, value: NOUN, over: ADP, time: NOUN, are: AUX, crucial: ADJ, factors: NOUN, in: ADP, realizing: VERB, the: DET, full: ADJ, potential: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, in: ADP, extracting: VERB, valuable: ADJ, insights: NOUN, from: ADP, large: ADJ, datasets: NOUN, .: PUNCT
