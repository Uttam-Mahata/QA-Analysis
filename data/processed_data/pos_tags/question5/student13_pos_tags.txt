S1: Data: NOUN, science: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, despite: SCONJ, its: PRON, widespread: ADJ, acclaim: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, can: AUX, face: VERB, challenges: NOUN, in: ADP, extracting: VERB, valuable: ADJ, insights: NOUN, from: ADP, large: ADJ, datasets: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S2: One: NUM, common: ADJ, hurdle: NOUN, is: AUX, the: DET, ": PUNCT, garbage: NOUN, in: ADV, ,: PUNCT, garbage: NOUN, out: ADP, ": PUNCT, phenomenon: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, where: SCONJ, the: DET, quality: NOUN, of: ADP, insights: NOUN, is: AUX, only: ADV, as: ADV, good: ADJ, as: ADP, the: DET, data: NOUN, input: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S3: Incomplete: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, inaccurate: ADJ, ,: PUNCT, or: CCONJ, biased: ADJ, datasets: NOUN, can: AUX, compromise: VERB, the: DET, reliability: NOUN, and: CCONJ, relevance: NOUN, of: ADP, the: DET, results: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S4: The: DET, interpretability: NOUN, of: ADP, machine: NOUN, learning: NOUN, models: NOUN, can: AUX, be: AUX, another: DET, stumbling: VERB, block: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S5: Complex: ADJ, algorithms: NOUN, may: AUX, produce: VERB, accurate: ADJ, predictions: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, but: CCONJ, understanding: VERB, how: SCONJ, these: DET, predictions: NOUN, are: AUX, reached: VERB, can: AUX, be: AUX, challenging: VERB, ,: PUNCT, leading: VERB, to: ADP, a: DET, lack: NOUN, of: ADP, trust: NOUN, among: ADP, stakeholders: NOUN, and: CCONJ, hindering: VERB, the: DET, adoption: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, -: PUNCT, driven: VERB, decisions: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S6: Moreover: ADV, ,: PUNCT, the: DET, scalability: NOUN, of: ADP, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, solutions: NOUN, can: AUX, be: AUX, an: DET, issue: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, especially: ADV, for: ADP, organizations: NOUN, with: ADP, limited: ADJ, resources: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S7: Implementing: VERB, robust: ADJ, infrastructure: NOUN, and: CCONJ, maintaining: VERB, the: DET, necessary: ADJ, computational: ADJ, power: NOUN, to: PART, handle: VERB, large: ADJ, datasets: NOUN, can: AUX, strain: VERB, budgets: NOUN, and: CCONJ, hinder: VERB, widespread: ADJ, adoption: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S8: Ethical: ADJ, considerations: NOUN, also: ADV, come: VERB, into: ADP, play: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, with: ADP, concerns: NOUN, about: ADP, data: NOUN, privacy: NOUN, and: CCONJ, potential: ADJ, biases: NOUN, in: ADP, algorithms: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S9: Addressing: VERB, these: DET, ethical: ADJ, dimensions: NOUN, is: AUX, crucial: ADJ, to: ADP, ensuring: VERB, that: SCONJ, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, is: AUX, applied: VERB, responsibly: ADV, and: CCONJ, without: ADP, reinforcing: VERB, existing: VERB, societal: ADJ, inequalities: NOUN, .: PUNCT
S10: In: ADP, conclusion: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, while: SCONJ, data: NOUN, science: NOUN, offers: VERB, immense: ADJ, potential: NOUN, ,: PUNCT, acknowledging: VERB, and: CCONJ, addressing: VERB, these: DET, challenges: NOUN, is: AUX, vital: ADJ, for: ADP, harnessing: VERB, its: PRON, full: ADJ, power: NOUN, and: CCONJ, ensuring: VERB, that: SCONJ, the: DET, insights: NOUN, derived: VERB, contribute: VERB, meaningfully: ADV, to: ADP, decision: NOUN, -: PUNCT, making: VERB, processes: NOUN, .: PUNCT
