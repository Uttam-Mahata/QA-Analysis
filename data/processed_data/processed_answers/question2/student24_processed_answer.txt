The theory of evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin, underscores the significance of natural selection in shaping species over time.
This mechanism operates on the principle that individuals with traits conducive to survival and reproduction have a higher likelihood of passing those traits to future generations.
The classic example of the peppered moth's adaptation to industrial pollution highlights how environmental pressures can drive evolutionary changes, providing a tangible instance of natural selection in action.
