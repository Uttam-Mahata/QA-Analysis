World War 3 could erupt due to a confluence of factors in the modern world.
Escalating geopolitical tensions driven by nationalism, territorial disputes, and resource competition among major powers are significant contributors.
Economic rivalries, characterized by trade disputes and disparities, may further strain international relations.
The pursuit of technological dominance, particularly in areas such as artificial intelligence and cyber warfare, introduces new avenues for conflict.
Nuclear proliferation risks, the potential involvement of non-state actors, and the destabilizing effects of climate change and mass migration add to the complexity.
The interconnected global economy, susceptible to cyber threats, and the weakening of international institutions present challenges to conflict resolution.
Successful diplomacy, global cooperation, and proactive measures are vital to prevent the outbreak of World War 3 amidst these intricate dynamics.
