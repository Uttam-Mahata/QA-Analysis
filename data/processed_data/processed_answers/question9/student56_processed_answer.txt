Several complex and interrelated factors could potentially trigger a world war, leading to widespread conflict on a global scale.
The development and deployment of advanced technologies, including cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, and space-based weaponry.
Technological advancements may be exploited for strategic advantages, increasing the potential for conflict.
Unforeseen global crises, such as pandemics, environmental catastrophes, or large-scale economic collapses, can create conditions conducive to conflict.
These crises could strain international relations and trigger conflicts over resources, blame attribution, or strategic advantages.
The rise of nationalism and populist movements can lead to an assertive and confrontational approach in international relations.
Nationalistic sentiments may be exploited to justify aggressive policies, potentially contributing to global conflicts.
Economic Instability: Severe economic crises, trade wars, and economic downturns can contribute to geopolitical tensions.
Economic instability may prompt nations to adopt aggressive policies, as a means of addressing domestic challenges.
