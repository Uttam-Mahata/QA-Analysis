The Industrial Revolution, spanning the late 18th and 19th centuries, left an indelible mark on the modern world.
It brought about a seismic economic transformation, shifting societies from agrarian to industrialized and capitalist structures.
This era saw the rise of mass production, facilitated by the establishment of factories and the adoption of pioneering technologies such as steam engines and mechanized production methods.
Urbanization burgeoned as people flocked to burgeoning industrial hubs, leading to profound social changes and the emergence of labor movements advocating for improved working conditions.
The impact extended globally, fostering globalization through increased trade and communication.
Despite positive outcomes like improved living conditions and healthcare, there were environmental repercussions.
Today, echoes of the Industrial Revolution persist in our economic systems, technological landscape, and societal structures, shaping the contemporary world in profound ways.
