How industrial revolution has impacted the modern world ?
Ans-
The Industrial Revolution, a period of major change from the late 1700s to the early 1800s, had a huge impact on the world we live in today.
It's like the foundation of many things we take for granted, like:

* **Stuff:** Factories boomed, churning out way more goods than ever before.
This led to lower prices and more variety of things to buy, from clothes and toys to tools and furniture.
* **Cities:** People flocked to cities for factory jobs, making them grow way faster.
This led to new buildings, transportation systems, and ways of living.
* **Science and tech:** The need for new machines and ways of working sparked a wave of inventions.
This led to breakthroughs in areas like medicine, transportation, and communication, shaping our modern world.
But it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows.
The Industrial Revolution also had some downsides:

* **Pollution:** Factories spewed smoke and fumes, making cities dirty and unhealthy.
* **Hard times:** Many factory workers faced long hours, low wages, and dangerous conditions.
This led to calls for better working conditions and worker rights.
* **Gaps between rich and poor:** The wealth created by the Industrial Revolution wasn't shared equally.
This led to a wider gap between the rich and the poor, which is still a challenge today.
Overall, the Industrial Revolution was a time of great change with both positive and negative consequences.
It's important to remember its history so we can learn from both the good and the bad, and build a better future for everyone.
