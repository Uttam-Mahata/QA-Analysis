Continental drift is a geological theory proposed by Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century, suggesting that Earth's continents were once connected as a single landmass called Pangaea and have since drifted apart over millions of years.
Wegener's theory was initially met with skepticism but laid the foundation for the modern understanding of plate tectonics.
Fossil evidence is one key aspect, as identical fossils of plants and animals have been found on continents that are now widely separated by oceans.
For example, the Mesosaurus, a freshwater reptile, is found in both South America and Africa.
This suggests that these continents were once connected.
Geological evidence includes the matching rock formations and mountain ranges on different continents.
For instance, the Appalachian Mountains in North America align with the Caledonian Mountains in Scotland and Scandinavia.
Paleoclimatic evidence also plays a role, with past climate indicators such as glacial deposits and coal beds showing patterns that make sense when continents are reconstructed into Pangaea.
Additionally, the fit of the continents' coastlines, particularly the east coast of South America with the west coast of Africa, further supports the notion of continental drift.
