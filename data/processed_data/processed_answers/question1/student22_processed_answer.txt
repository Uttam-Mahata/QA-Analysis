The theory of continental drift proposes that Earth's continents were once assembled into the supercontinent Pangaea, gradually dispersing and shifting to their present locations.
Evidence supporting this theory includes the congruence of coastlines, identical rock formations, and fossils found on opposite sides of oceans.
The fit of continental shelves and the alignment of mountain ranges across continents contribute to the argument of a shared geological history.
Additionally, the discovery of mid-ocean ridges and magnetic striping on the ocean floor provides further substantiation for the continuous movement of tectonic plates.
Collectively, these observations fortify the theory of continental drift, forming the essential basis for our understanding of plate tectonics.
