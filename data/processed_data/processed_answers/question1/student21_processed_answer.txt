Continental drift theory suggests that Earth's continents were once interconnected in the supercontinent Pangaea, gradually separating and drifting to their current positions.
Evidential support includes the correlation of coastlines, identical rock formations, and fossils discovered on opposite sides of oceans.
The fit of continental shelves and the alignment of mountain ranges across continents add weight to the argument of a shared geological history.
Furthermore, the revelation of mid-ocean ridges and magnetic striping on the ocean floor serves as compelling evidence for the ongoing movement of tectonic plates.
In essence, these observations collectively validate the theory of continental drift, laying the essential groundwork for our understanding of plate tectonics.
