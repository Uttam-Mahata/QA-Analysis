The French Revolution was that domino, toppling the ancient regime of France and sending tremors through the entire world, forever altering its political, social, and intellectual landscape.
Firstly, the Revolution shattered the divine right of kings, replacing it with the notion of popular sovereignty.
The ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity resonated across borders, inspiring revolutions and uprisings from Haiti to Poland, challenging the legitimacy of absolute monarchies everywhere.
Secondly, the Revolution ushered in the age of democracy.
The birth of the First Republic, with its emphasis on citizen participation and representative government, provided a blueprint for other nations seeking to break free from autocratic rule.
Thirdly, the Revolution redefined social structures.
The dismantling of feudalism and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen challenged class hierarchies and paved the way for greater social mobility.
Though its full realization took time, the seeds of social equality were sown.
Fourthly, the Revolution became a potent symbol of anti-colonialism.
Slaves in Saint-Domingue, inspired by the revolutionary ideals, fought for their own freedom, establishing the first independent black republic in the Western Hemisphere.
