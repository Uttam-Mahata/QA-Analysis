Machine learning (ML) is grounded in several fundamental principles that collectively contribute to the development of intelligent systems.
One key principle is supervised learning, where algorithms are trained on labeled datasets, allowing them to make predictions or decisions based on input features.
This process involves the model learning patterns and relationships within the data, enabling it to generalize to unseen examples.
Another essential principle is unsupervised learning, which involves training models on unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or structures.
This is particularly valuable when the system needs to uncover intrinsic features without explicit guidance.
Reinforcement learning introduces the concept of agents learning through interaction with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
This principle is crucial for systems that require decision-making and dynamic adaptation to changing circumstances.
Transfer learning is a principle that leverages knowledge gained from one task to improve performance on another related task.
This enables systems to apply previously acquired knowledge to new domains, enhancing efficiency and reducing the need for extensive training data.
