The fundamental principles of machine learning include:

1.
Supervised Learning: Utilizes labeled training data to predict or classify new, unseen data.
2.
Unsupervised Learning: Involves finding patterns and relationships in unlabeled data without predefined outputs.
3.
Reinforcement Learning: Agents learn by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
4.
Feature Engineering: Involves selecting or transforming relevant input features to improve model performance.
5.
Model Evaluation: Involves assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
These principles contribute to the development of intelligent systems by enabling them to adapt, learn, and improve over time.
Machine learning models can make predictions, recognize patterns, and optimize decision-making processes, leading to the creation of more intelligent and efficient systems across various domains, such as healthcare, finance, and robotics.
