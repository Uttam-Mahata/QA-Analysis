Machine learning (ML) is grounded in several fundamental principles that collectively contribute to the development of intelligent systems.
One key principle is supervised learning, where algorithms are trained on labeled datasets, allowing them to make predictions or decisions based on input features.Another essential principle is unsupervised learning, which involves training models on unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or structures.
Ensemble learning combines multiple models to enhance predictive accuracy and robustness.
By aggregating the strengths of individual models, ensemble methods contribute to more reliable and generalized intelligent systems.
The principles of feature engineering and dimensionality reduction play a pivotal role in optimizing machine learning models.
Feature engineering involves selecting, transforming, or creating relevant features to improve model performance, while dimensionality reduction techniques help manage complex datasets by reducing the number of input variables without compromising critical information.
The principles of bias and fairness are crucial in ensuring that intelligent systems treat diverse groups equitably.
Addressing biases in training data and algorithms is essential to avoid discriminatory outcomes and to promote ethical AI practices.
