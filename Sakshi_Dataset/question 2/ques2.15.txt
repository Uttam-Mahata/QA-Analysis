Elaborate on the concept of natural selection and its role in the theory of evolution. Provide examples of how natural selection can lead to the adaptation of species over time.
Ans-
The concept of natural selection, a cornerstone in the theory of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin, delineates a mechanism through which species undergo adaptive changes over generations. Natural selection is driven by the differential survival and reproduction of individuals within a population based on their inherited traits.

In essence, organisms with advantageous traits that enhance their ability to survive and reproduce in a given environment are more likely to pass these traits on to the next generation. Over time, this process results in the accumulation of favorable traits in a population, leading to the gradual adaptation of the species to its specific ecological niche.

One example illustrating natural selection is the evolution of the peppered moth (Biston betularia) during the Industrial Revolution in England. Initially, the majority of these moths had light-colored wings, providing effective camouflage against the light-colored bark of trees. However, with the onset of industrialization and increased air pollution, the dark-colored variant of the moth became more advantageous, as it blended better with the soot-covered trees. Consequently, the frequency of dark-colored moths increased over time due to their enhanced survival against predation, showcasing the impact of natural selection in response to environmental changes.

Another instance is the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. When exposed to antibiotics, susceptible bacteria are killed, but a small proportion with naturally occurring resistance survive. These resistant bacteria then proliferate, passing on their resistance traits to subsequent generations. With continued exposure to antibiotics, the population gradually becomes dominated by resistant individuals, illustrating how natural selection operates at the microbial level.

In both examples, the underlying principle is the same: individuals with traits that confer a survival or reproductive advantage in a specific environment are more likely to contribute to the next generation, shaping the characteristics of the population over time. Natural selection, thus, stands as a pivotal force in the dynamic process of evolution, driving the adaptation of species to their changing surroundings.
