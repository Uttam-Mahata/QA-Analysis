What are the fundamental principles of machine learning, and how do they contribute to the development of intelligent systems?
Ans-
Machine learning is based on three fundamental principles: representation, evaluation, and optimization. Representation refers to how the model looks and how knowledge is represented. Evaluation involves differentiating good models and evaluating programs. Optimization is the process of finding good models and generating programs. These principles contribute to the development of intelligent systems by enabling machines to train from data, improve their performance over time, and make informed predictions or decisions. By leveraging machine learning techniques, AI systems can analyze significant amounts of data, identify patterns, and make informed predictions or decisions, leading to the continuous improvement of AI systems' intelligence and efficiency. Machine learning is a crucial component of AI, allowing computers to learn without being explicitly programmed, and it plays a pivotal role in enhancing the capabilities of AI, making it more intelligent, adaptive, and efficient[1][2][5].
