Explain the concept of social stratification and its impact on societies.
Ans-
Social stratification is the societal arrangement where individuals or groups are organized into hierarchies based on factors such as wealth, education, occupation, and social status. This intricate web of social divisions profoundly impacts societies in various dimensions.

Economically, social stratification engenders disparities in access to resources and opportunities. Wealthier strata often enjoy better education, healthcare, and job prospects, perpetuating inequality across generations. This economic divide can contribute to the formation of distinct social classes, each with its own set of privileges and challenges.

Moreover, social stratification influences the dynamics of power and decision-making. Those in higher strata tend to have more influence, shaping policies and societal norms. This concentration of power can create challenges for marginalized groups in having their voices heard and needs addressed.

Culturally, social stratification influences social interactions and relationships. Stereotypes and prejudices may emerge based on perceived social status, affecting how individuals from different strata interact and perceive each other.

In essence, social stratification weaves a complex tapestry that defines the fabric of societies. Recognizing its impact is crucial for fostering social cohesion, as addressing inequalities and promoting social mobility become imperative for the well-being and harmony of diverse communities
