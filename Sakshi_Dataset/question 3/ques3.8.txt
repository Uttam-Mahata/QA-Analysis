Explain the concept of social stratification and its impact on societies.
Ans-
Social stratification is a particular form of social inequality. All societies arrange their members
in terms of superiority, inferiority and equality. Stratification is a process of interaction or
differentiation whereby some people come to rank higher than others.
In one word, when individuals and groups are ranked, according to some commonly accepted
basis of valuation in a hierarchy of status levels based upon the inequality of social positions,
social stratification occurs. Social stratification means division of society into different strata or
layers. It involves a hierarchy of social groups. Members of a particular layer have a common
identity. They have a similar life style.
The Indian Caste system provides an example of stratification system. The society in which
divisions of social classes exist is known as a stratified society. Modern stratification
fundamentally differs from stratification of primitive societies. Social stratification involves two
phenomena (i) differentiation of individuals or groups on the basis of possession of certain
characteristics whereby some individuals or groups come to rank higher than others, (ii) the
ranking of individuals according to some basis of evaluation.
Sociologists are concerned not merely with the facts of social differences but also with their
social evaluation.
