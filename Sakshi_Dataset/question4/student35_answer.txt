Discuss the impact of the French Revolution on European societies and global politics.
Ans-
The French Revolution is generally taken as the advent of European popular
democracy. Proclaiming that all public authority derives from the consent of
the governed, the revolutionaries reconfigured national and local administration to the principle of popular sovereignty. During the revolutionary decade,
in consequence, the French were called upon to vote for their national representatives, local administrators, judicial officials, and ecclesiastics on about
twenty occasions. Yet, despite their scope and frequency, revolutionary elections were never the decisive turning points in the political life of the nation
that one might expect. Insurrection, civil war, and coups d'etat proved more
important than elections in determining the course of revolutionary politics.
Patrice Gueniffey's pathbreaking study, Le nombre et la raison, seeks to
explain why elections were unable to guarantee the peaceful expression of
political difference and the smooth transfer of power during the French Revolution.
Gueniffey's work intersects with a broad multi-disciplinary reflection on
the question of why democracies succeed or fail. In recent years, this classic
problem has received growing attention that seems likely only to increase as
fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe and elsewhere falter, and established
democracies experience what one author has termed a "malaise."
 The pessimism characteristic of the generation of observers who witnessed the rise of
fascism and Soviet-style totalitarianism in Europe and the imposition of military dictatorship or one-party rule in South American and post-colonial states
shows little sign of abating as the twentieth century draws to a close.
 Scholars concerned with these disheartening trends have generally employed two
kinds of analysis to explain the difficulties of democracy.
