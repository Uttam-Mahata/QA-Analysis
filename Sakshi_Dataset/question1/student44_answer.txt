Explain the concept of continental drift and provide evidence supporting this theory.
Ans-
Imagine a giant jigsaw puzzle. Billions of years ago, Earth's continents were all snuggly fit together, forming one supercontinent named Pangea. Then, like an impatient child, Earth gave the puzzle a shove, and the pieces started drifting apart. That's the essence of continental drift!

But unlike a mischievous kid, Earth's continental shuffle wasn't random. Powerful forces beneath the surface, like tugging and pushing tectonic plates, drove the continents on their epic voyages. Here's some evidence that proves they weren't just daydreaming:

The Jigsaw Fit: The coastlines of South America and Africa seem like they were once glued together, with a perfect puzzle-piece match. It's not just their shapes, but also the types of rocks and fossils found on both sides, whispering tales of a shared past.

Fossil Family Reunion: Remember those goofy family reunions where everyone looks strangely similar? Fossils tell a similar story. Plants and animals couldn't have hopped across vast oceans, so finding the same fossilized ferns in Argentina and South Africa suggests they were once neighbors on Pangea.

Magnetic Messages: Rocks are like tiny time capsules, storing the Earth's magnetic field at the moment they formed. Comparing magnetic patterns in rocks from different continents reveals they were once aligned, like soldiers in a parade, before drifting to their current positions.

The Big Picture: Continental drift explains more than just coastlines and fossils. It sheds light on mountain ranges formed by colliding continents, the opening and closing of oceans, and even the distribution of climate zones. It's like unlocking a secret code to understand Earth's dynamic history.

While the term "continental drift" has been superseded by the broader theory of plate tectonics, its essence remains. So, the next time you look at a map, remember, those continents weren't always loners. They were once part of a grand family reunion, their epic journey shaping the world we know today.
