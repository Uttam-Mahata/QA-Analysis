Explain the concept of continental drift and provide evidence supporting this theory.
Ans-
The paradigm-shifting notion of continental drift, pioneered by Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century, brought a seismic shift in our perception of Earth's geological narrative. Wegener's proposition posited that continents, once interlocked in a supercontinent named Pangaea, embarked on a protracted journey, gradually dispersing to their current configurations.

Support for Wegener's theory emerged from a mosaic of compelling evidence. Firstly, the conspicuous congruence of coastlines, particularly the snug fit between the eastern boundary of South America and the western edge of Africa, alluded to a prior togetherness that transcended mere coincidence.

Secondly, the discovery of analogous fossils on continents presently separated by vast expanses of water provided a poignant testament to historical continental unity. The presence of identical plant and animal fossils hinted at an era when these regions were interconnected.

Geological features, including shared mountain ranges and rock formations, constituted another facet of the evidence. Instances like the alignment of the Appalachian Mountains in North America with the Caledonian Mountains in Scotland and Scandinavia underscored a geological history of adjacency.

Paleoclimatic indicators, such as glacial imprints and evidence of ancient climates, further fortified the continental drift theory. Glacial striations and tillites in geographically remote regions implied a past proximity within a cohesive landmass.

While Wegener's continental drift initially faced skepticism, the mid-20th century ushered in the embrace of plate tectonicsâ€”a comprehensive theory elucidating the movement of Earth's lithospheric plates over the pliable asthenosphere. This integration solidified the foundations of our understanding of Earth's dynamic geological processes.

In essence, continental drift, woven from a diverse fabric of evidence, revolutionized our grasp of Earth's geological ballet. Its assimilation into the broader tapestry of plate tectonics enriches our narrative of the planet's intricate geological saga.
