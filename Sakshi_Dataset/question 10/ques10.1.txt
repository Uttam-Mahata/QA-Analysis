Electric vehicles are said to be greener, but electricity production itself causes a lot of pollution. What do you think about this ?
Ans-
Electric vehicles (EVs) are often considered greener than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles due to their lower direct emissions. However, the environmental impact of EVs is closely tied to the source of electricity. If the electricity comes from renewable sources like wind or solar, the overall environmental footprint is significantly reduced.

While it's true that some regions still rely on fossil fuels for electricity generation, the shift towards cleaner energy sources is ongoing. Governments and industries worldwide are investing in renewable energy infrastructure to make the electricity grid more sustainable.

Additionally, advancements in battery technology are improving the efficiency of energy storage in EVs. Recycling initiatives for used batteries further contribute to minimizing environmental impact.

In essence, the green credentials of electric vehicles depend on the broader energy landscape. As we transition to cleaner energy sources, the benefits of EVs in reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions will continue to grow, making them a crucial element in sustainable transportation solutions.
