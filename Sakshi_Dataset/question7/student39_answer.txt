What are the main components of a relational database management system (RDBMS),and how do they facilitate efficient data organization and retrieval?
Ans-
The main components of a relational database management system (RDBMS) are:

1. **Tables**: These are collections of records or tuples containing values associated with columns or attributes.
2. **Tuples (Records)**: Individual records or horizontal entities within a table.
3. **Columns (Attributes)**: Vertical entities that define the attributes of the data.
4. **Domains**: Probable terms collected jointly that always have the same characteristics.
5. **Schemas**: Logical containers that group related database objects together, such as tables, views, and indexes.
6. **Keys**: Unique identifiers used to identify each record in a table and ensure data integrity.

These components facilitate efficient data organization and retrieval by providing a structured framework for storing and managing data. By leveraging these components, RDBMSs enable organizations to efficiently manage and analyze large amounts of data, making them an essential tool for businesses and other organizations. The use of tables, records, and attributes allows for the systematic organization of data, making it easier to store and retrieve information. Additionally, the use of keys and domains helps ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data, which is essential for efficient retrieval and manipulation.
