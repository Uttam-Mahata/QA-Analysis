What are the main components of a relational database management system (RDBMS),and how do they facilitate efficient data organization and retrieval?
Ans-
The main components of a relational database management system (RDBMS) include tables, tuples (records), columns (attributes), domains, schemas, and keys. These components facilitate efficient data organization and retrieval by providing a structured framework for storing and managing data. Tables are used to store related data elements in a row-based structure, with each row representing a record or tuple, and each column representing an attribute. Domains describe the possible values that a column can hold, and schemas are used to logically group related database objects together. Keys are used to identify each record in a table and ensure data integrity. By leveraging these components, RDBMSs enable organizations to efficiently manage and analyze large amounts of data, making them an essential tool for businesses and other organizations.
