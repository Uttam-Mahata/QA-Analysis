What possible factors/tensions in modern world may lead to World War 3?
Ans-
The specter of World War 3 looms amid complex global dynamics, shaped by a convergence of factors. Geopolitical rivalries between major powers, notably the United States, China, and Russia, pose a palpable threat. Disputes over territories, particularly in the South China Sea and Eastern Europe, possess the potential to escalate into large-scale conflicts, drawing nations into a web of hostilities.

Economic competition, driven by disparities and trade tensions, adds fuel to the fire. The race for technological supremacy, notably in fields like artificial intelligence and cyber warfare, heightens global tensions, fostering an environment ripe for conflict.

Environmental pressures, such as resource scarcity and the impacts of climate change, further complicate the landscape. Competition for essential resources like water and land may amplify existing disputes, leading to heightened international tensions.

Amidst these challenges, the prevalence of extremist ideologies and regional conflicts introduces another layer of volatility to the global stage. To avert the cataclysmic consequences of a potential World War 3, prioritizing effective diplomacy, fostering international cooperation, and fortifying conflict resolution mechanisms are imperative for maintaining global stability
