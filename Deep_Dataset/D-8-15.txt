The Industrial Revolution was a period of significant change that transformed the world in many ways. It brought about new manufacturing processes, such as the assembly line, the rise of the factory system, and the development of new technologies and green revolution played an important role in it.

One of the primary benefits of the Green Revolution was a substantial increase in crop yields. New high-yielding varieties of seeds, along with improved irrigation techniques and the use of fertilizers, contributed to a surge in agricultural productivity. This helped address the growing global demand for food as populations expanded.

The higher yields resulting from the Green Revolution contributed to enhanced food security. With increased production, many countries were able to achieve self-sufficiency in food production, reducing their dependence on imports and mitigating the risk of food shortages.

The Green Revolution played a role in reducing poverty by increasing farmers' incomes. Higher crop yields and improved farming techniques led to increased profitability for many agricultural communities, contributing to improved living standards.

The increased agricultural productivity resulting from the Green Revolution had positive implications for the global economy. Countries that successfully adopted these technologies became major players in the international agricultural market, contributing to economic growth and trade.
