The cost of electricity can be influenced by various factors, and fluctuations in pricing are often a result of complex interactions between these elements. One of the most important reason is the introduction of electric vehicles which instead of using fossile fuels , use electricity.

The cost of electricity generation is heavily influenced by the prices of the fuels used in power plants. Fluctuations in the prices of coal, natural gas, oil, or other primary energy sources directly impact the overall cost of electricity production. If fuel prices rise, it tends to lead to an increase in electricity prices.

The need for infrastructure upgrades and investments in the electricity generation, transmission, and distribution systems can contribute to higher costs. Modernizing aging infrastructure, incorporating renewable energy sources, and enhancing grid reliability often require substantial investments that can be passed on to consumers.

While renewable energy sources contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable energy mix, the initial investment costs for renewable technologies, such as solar and wind, can be relatively high. However, as technology advances and economies of scale are achieved, the long-term cost trajectory for renewables is generally expected to decrease.
