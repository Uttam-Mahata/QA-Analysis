War has profound and multifaceted effects on the world economy, impacting various sectors and contributing to economic disruptions. The consequences can be both immediate and long-term, affecting nations involved in the conflict as well as the global economic landscape.

Destruction of Infrastructure: Wars often result in the destruction of critical infrastructure, including roads, bridges, factories, and utilities. The rebuilding process requires significant financial resources and time, diverting funds away from productive investments.

Wars lead to the displacement of populations and disrupt labor markets. People are forced to flee their homes, and the loss of a skilled workforce can result in decreased productivity. This displacement also places a burden on host countries or regions dealing with an influx of refugees.

Wars disrupt international trade and supply chains, affecting both importers and exporters. Ports may be damaged or closed, and transportation routes may become unsafe. Trade barriers, sanctions, and embargoes further hinder the flow of goods and services.

Nations involved in wars allocate a substantial portion of their budgets to military spending. This diverts resources away from essential services, social programs, and infrastructure development, hindering overall economic growth.
